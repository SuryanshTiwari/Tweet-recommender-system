And, marking the dawn of a new day, the housemates wake up dancing to the tunes of the song ‘Telephone dhun mein hasne wali’ all prepared for the next leg of the nominations task. Om Swami is seen dancing in the secret house while matching steps with Mona Lisa in the house. Gaurav Chopra and VJ Bani seem to be bonding big time, they are spotted having a conversation about Gaurav’s marriage and how his matrimonial profile will read like. As Gaurav describes the girl of his dreams according to his mother, Bani is unable to hold on to her laughter.As the second round of the nominations task continues, Manu picks up the phone and is commanded by Bigg Boss to convince Manveer to shave off his beard.  Quite possessive about his beard, Manveer requests Bigg Boss if he can do something else rather than shaving off the beard.  On understanding that Manveer has invested nine months in growing his beard and considers it to be a lucky charm, Manu  tells him that he is ready to get nominated if Manveer is not willing to do the task. This leaves Manveer in a confused state of mind and he decides to give it a second thought. But eventually he saves his friend from getting nominated.The Bigg Boss 10 contestants.Furthermore, making Manveer’s life even more difficult, Manu nominates him to sit on the throne next. In order to save himself, Manveer has to convince Rohan to dress up like a girl and stay in the garb until Bigg Boss’s further notice. Knowing the fact that Rohan will never agree to do cross dress to save Manveer, he comes up with a strategy and decides to manipulate Lopa instead. He calls Lopa and Rohan and tells them  that either Lopa  needs to destroy her makeup or Rohan  needs to dress up like a girl. Rohan tells Manveer that he would take a decision after he sees the full attire. Next in line is Karan who is asked to convince Lokesh to nominate herself and give up on the chance to get safe from nominations. Karan puts Lokesh in a fix and one thing leads to the other when Lokesh ends up taking a wrong decision due to some confusion in understanding the task.Later in the day, Navin takes on the seat and is asked to convince Nitibha to give away her make up for the entire season.  Navin sweet talks Nitibha into sacrificing her makeup and ensures that he would get Lopa and Bani to share makeup with her.  Bani narrates the entire conversation to the celebrities. However, Lopa goes and tells Navin a completely different version and says that Bani claims that Navin would steal Lopa and Bani’s make-up for Nitibha. Navin confronts Bani and they both get into a fight and even hurl abuses at each other, all thanks to Lopa’s misunderstanding. Bani feels targeted and tries to explain her stand but fails to do so. She further lashes out at Lopa for putting her in a bad spot and they both have an argument. Subsequently, Bani and Mona have a showdown when Bani tells Mona to leave the area where she and Gaurav were chatting.Further, Gaurav is seen advising Bani to share her problems with the fellow housemates and avoid snapping at everyone. While Bani listens to him patiently, she breaks down and tells him that this is her true side and she prefers to be left by herself to deal with her problems. With the contestants’ friendships and relationships put to test, Manveer, Rahul, Lokesh and Navin eventually get nominated for this week’s eviction.Ending on a dramatic note, Bigg Boss announces the merger of the two teams – celebrities and commoners. Henceforth, there are no 'maliks' and 'sevaks' and a new dynamic has been set in motion. Three weeks ago, the contestants entered the Bigg Boss house in two teams,  celebrities and Indiawale (commoners). They were further divided into sevaks and maliks. The maliks had the privilege to gets all the work they wanted done through the sevaks. Bigg Boss goes on to state that 22 days later none of them are unknown and hence Bigg Boss has done away with the labels and from now on they will be regarded simply as housemates. There will be no more sevaks- maliks or celebrities-Indiawale. This merger has garnered mixed reactions from the residence and is definitely going to create tension in the Bigg Boss House. While the division existed, the sevaks were in charge of housekeeping and cooking for the housemates while the maliks rested. With no specific group responsible for the chores, it will be interesting to see who takes up the initiative to look after the house. Related NewsBigg Boss 10 Episode 21, 7th November 2016 written episode: Nominations become a game of sacrifice Comment using DisqusPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Show Comments LIVE Zimbabwe Vs Sri Lanka Live Score ZIM vs SL | Nov 6th, 2016Live Coverage SL 102 4 40.0RUNSWKTSOVERSCricket ScoresCurrent & RecentUpcomingPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 7 wickets (D/L method) Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Live Now Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Papua New Guinea beat Hong Kong by 14 runs Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 106 runs South Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS Vs SA South Africa beat Australia by 177 runs Pakistan and West Indies in UAE, 3 Test Series, 2016 PAK Vs WI West Indies beat Pakistan by 5 wickets New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ India beat New Zealand by 190 runs Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Sri Lanka beat Zimbabwe by 225 runs England in Bangladesh, 2 Test Series, 2016 BAN Vs ENG Bangladesh beat England by 108 runs New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ New Zealand beat India by 19 runs England in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 9th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 12th, 2016, 05:00 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 14th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 16th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTPakistan in New Zealand, 2 Test Series, 2016 NZ vs PAK - Nov 17th, 2016, 03:00 AM ISTEngland in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 17th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs WI - Nov 19th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 21st, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 23rd, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 24th, 2016, 09:00 AM ISTMORE STORIES FROMSeema Sinha Bigg Boss 10 Episode 23, 8 November 2016: No more malik, sevaks; all contestants merge Bigg Boss 10, episode 19, 4th November 2016 Written Update: Friction flares between Bani and Lopa Bigg Boss 10, episode 18, 3rd November 2016 Written Episode: Gaurav, Bani, Rahul punished for rule-breaking Shah Rukh Khan’s birthday: Is Raees the reason for actor not hosting his usual party?

Kameshwari | New Delhi | Published:November 8, 2016 7:30 pm Bigg Boss 10: Who will get nominated this week? Ever since Bigg Boss season 10 started, a constant shuffle of power happened between Indiawale and celebrities to win the title of Maliks only because Sevaks had to do all house work while the Maliks had the privilege of taking every possible advantage. However, from now on there will be no such demarcation between both the groups as now Bigg Boss house will see no barriers. During the demarcation, celebrities were the first ones to become the Sevaks of the house while Indiawale had the longest run as the Maliks of the house, that of two weeks. The tables will turn in the coming episode making the housemates wonder what’s in store for them. Bigg Boss announces that how the house was initially divided into two halves and going forward, all will be on the same level and will be addressed as housemates. Bigg Boss celebrated this moment by burning the rule book pages displayed in the garden area. While the merger comes as a shocker for some of the housemates, others are seen rejoicing this moment. It remains to be seen, how this will change the dynamics inside the house.

Parismita Goswami November 8, 2016 15:23 IST Bigg Boss 10 nominations. Pictured: Bigg Boss 10 contestantsBigg Boss/twitterThe makers of Bigg Boss 10, hosted by Salman Khan, are leaving no stone unturned to keep the audience hooked to the show. Besides the daily doses of drama and arguments, the twists and turns in the game rules are keeping the viewers engrossed. Last week, Om Swami, who was supposed to be eliminated from the show, was seen moved to a secret room from where he is keeping an eye on the housemates and their gossips. While the audience must be wondering as to who will be the next contestant to be evicted from the house, a reliable Twitter handle, Reality Post, which had predicted the nominations and evictions of the show last year, has revealed the list of nominated contestants of the second week of Bigg Boss 10.

RelatedFind out who Salman Khan wants to win the US Presidential election 2016Bigg Boss 10 spoiler: Eliminated contestant to be kept in secret room According to the report, Lokesh Sharma, Rahul Dev and Manveer Gurjar have been nominated for eviction this week. With this, the nominated contestants will have to buckle up and impress the audience and save themselves from being ousted from the show. Although the eviction of the controversial show has always shocked the audience, going by the nominated contestants, it seems Lokesh and Manveer will be saved considering that they are among the viewers' favourites. Meanwhile, rumour had it that Priyanka Jagga, who was the first contestant to be eliminated from Bigg Boss 10, would be re-entering the house sometime last week. The commoner had raised quite a few eyebrows with her heated arguments with VJ Bani and Rohan Mehra and her eviction shocked millions. Soon after her eviction, speculations were rife that Priyanka would re-enter as wild card or she may be kept in a secret room and may return. #LokeshSharma #RahulDev and #ManveerGurjar are NOMINATED for EVICTION this week on #BB10 #BiggBoss10 (sources)— RealityPost (@TheRealityPost) November 7, 2016 Also readBigg Boss 10: Here's how viewers have reacted to rumours of Priyanka Jagga's returnBigg Boss 10: Om Swami sent to secret room; here's how viewers have reacted on social media Post Comment IBT TV Close Kanye West cuts concert short after Kim Kardashian robbed at gunpoint Why advertise with us?

Love it or hate it, but you can't ignore it. It's the 10th edition of the Indian reality TV series Bigg Boss and this year, celebrities and non-celebrities are busy trying to entertain us with their antics. The seven celebrities comprise team 'Celebrities' while the eight non-celebs are the 'Indiawale'.Considering the various spats, punishments, groupism and general behaviour in the Bigg Boss house which does tend to make us wide-eyed with utter disbelief, we often wonder whether the bunch was as so-needs-to-be-tamed in school? Were they all the unmanageable ones in college? For that matter, what makes these guys tick? What are their interests and what have they studied? So here you are, with all the information you ever wanted on what the Bigg Boss contestants studied. And we must say, with their educational qualifications, these contestants could have made it anywhere. But they chose Bigg Boss. And therein hangs a tale. Nitibha KaulNow this one is a former Google employee - an account strategist, to boot. And she has a Bachelor's Business Studies degree from the University of Delhi. So basically, Nitibha Kaul not only cracked the difficulty BBS entrance test at DU, she also got through those kick-ass Google interviews. And now, she's cracked Bigg Boss.

Model Lopamudra Raut gave TV star Gaurav Chopra a reason to blush as she revealed that she feels he is the ‘hottest’ male contestant on the show. The two have been seen getting along well and guess the compliment coming from the stunning model will only increase Gaurav’s fondness for her. More from the world of Entertainment: This revelation came as a part of the luxury budget task. Competing against each other, the two teams (celebrities and commoners) were asked questions about each other, revealing intimate details about their perceptions pertaining to one another. When it was Lopamudra’s turn, she found herself face-to-face with Nitibha who had to respond to questions about Lopa’s preferences and relationships inside the house. One of those questions was who the beauty queen felt was the hottest male contestant inside the house. While Nitibha guessed that Lopa might feel that Rahul is the hottest, Lopa coyly deemed her wrong and revealed that she felt it was Gaurav. The actor smiled at the compliment. What, however, was equally interesting that Rahul, a former supermodel, doubted his hotness quotient as he couldn’t stop shaking his head and denying the claim when Nitbha guessed his name! Nitibha got one wrong but it is yet to be seen which team wins the luxury budget task. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & InstagramOpinionAre banks equipped to replace 2,300 crore pieces of Rs 500, Rs 1,000 notes?WorldUS presidential elections 2016 LIVE: Clinton has 70 per cent chance of winning, says top pollsterBusinessDemonetising Rs 500, 1000 notes a very bold step to fight black money: RBIBusinessRs 500 and 1000 currency demonitised: PM ModiIndiaJ&K: Jawan killed as Pak troops violate ceasefire in Naushera, firing continuesEntertainmentWe are not good swimmers: Kannada actors said minutes before they drowned, watch videoEntertainmentShivaay box office: Ajay Devgn film bests Ae Dil Hai Mushkil in second weekEntertainmentMastigudi makers booked for culpable homicide, Kannada actors' bodies yet to be foundEntertainmentAishwarya's new photoshoot has made us forget ADHM Must ReadSportsIndia vs England, 2016: Ready to hum immigrant songSportsCook back where he beganSportsEngland’s lesser-known fan army-Addis lands in RajkotTechnologyLenovo Phab 2 Plus first look: Dual camera and AR are the highlightsTechnologySony Xperia XZ review: A great flagship device, but competition is toughTechnologyMotorola Moto M goes official: Specifications, price and featuresLifestyleScientists say this song is the most relaxing song in the world Nov 08: Latest News Amit Shah invokes triple talaq to strike at ‘three parties’: Are you with or against it?01:52 am, Nov 09, 2016Simultaneous Lok Sabha, Assembly polls: Delhi HC junks plea but calls it ‘good idea’01:40 am, Nov 09, 2016US Presidential elections 2016: Wall Street climbs as investors bet on Hillary Clinton victory01:44 am, Nov 09, 2016Rs 500, Rs 1000 notes declared illegal: RBI issues 25-point FAQ explaining move01:38 am, Nov 09, 2016Rishabh Pant: Season’s smash hit breaks another record01:38 am, Nov 09, 2016 Priyanka Sharma ... read more On husband Vivek Dahiya’s birthday, Divyanka Tripathi posts the sweetest message from Australia, see picsSanjay Dutt’s wife Maanyata Dutt has the perfect beach time with kids in Sri Lanka, see picsPadmavati: Delhi designers to create Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor’s looks Priyanka Sharma ... read more On husband Vivek Dahiya’s birthday, Divyanka Tripathi posts the sweetest message from Australia, see picsSanjay Dutt’s wife Maanyata Dutt has the perfect beach time with kids in Sri Lanka, see picsPadmavati: Delhi designers to create Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor’s looks The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Seema Sinha  Updated: Nov 4, 2016 15:42 IST #Antara Biswas   #Bani J   #Bigg Boss 10   #Bigg Boss 10 contestants   #Bigg Boss 10 winner   #bigg Boss Season 10   #Bigg Boss Weekend Ka Vaar   #Colors TV   #Gaurav Chopra   #Kamya Punjabi   #Karan Mehra   #Lopamudra Raut   #Manoj Punjabi   #Manveer Gujjar   #Mona Lisa   #Rohan Mehra   #Salman Khan   #Swami Om Colors TV’s long-running reality show Bigg Boss is now heading into the third week of its tenth season.And in this duration, it’s clearly the ‘Indiawale’ — the non-celebrity contestants on the show — who’ve proven to be the bigger stars.Except for the recent ‘secret task’ (where the celebrities had to capture the Indiawale in 12 orchestrated moments, like a sting operation), the ‘commoners’ as they’re called, have given the celebrities tough competition every step of the way.The Indiawale have given the celebrities tough competition on every task in Bigg Boss 10 so far***Former Bigg Boss contestant Kamya Punjabi has been closely following Bigg Boss 10 — especially since she’s been called upon to provide her comments and analysis to the present set of contenders in the ‘Weekend Ka Vaar’ special episodes hosted by Salman Khan.Kamya sat down with Firstpost to share her impressions of the contestants’ performance so far:“It’s an hour-long show, but I can see the celebrities only for 10 minutes and rest of it is dominated by the Indiawale,” Kamya said. “Be it entertainment, or from the content/show/TRP point of view, it is the Indiawale who are doing exceedingly well.”She added a tart observation: “Haven't the celebrities removed their make-up yet? I don’t see passion among the celebrity contestants in doing the tasks. The Indiawale are taking a stand, celebrities are not. There’s no ‘bulund awaaz’ (strong voice) among the celebrities, although I like Lopamudra Raut and Rohan Mehra because they do come out strongly at times. When Priyanka (Jagga) was wreaking havoc in the house in the first week, none of the celebrities had the guts to take a stand against her. She kept saying that she was playing a game, doing a task and she was making it entertaining. So why blame her?”Kamya feels, based on their strong showing so far, it wouldn’t come as a major surprise if one of the Indiawale was to win Bigg Boss 10.Television actor and host Karan Wahi also shared a similar thought. “It looks like the celebrities are extras in a movie,” he said. “They’re seen only seen in the background while the commoners are always at the forefront.”Meanwhile, season one contestant Kashmira Shah said that knowing some of the celebrity contenders personally, their lacklustre showing was a bit of a surprise. "I don't understand why aren't they being themselves? I can understand the celebrities don't want to fight, but at least take a stand. Gaurav (Chopra) is a friend and he's trying his best not to retaliate. But it's okay to fight back if you are in the right. Taking s**t is the biggest stupidity. The Indiawale are doing well as they have nothing to lose. Ultimately, the show has to be entertaining. I'm loving Swami Om and Manu — it's fun to watch them. How I wish I was inside the house! In tasks, you have to do whatever you are told but celebrities should forget who they are and stop taking s**t; they have to pull up their socks."Kashmira added, "I'm missing Rakhi Sawant and Sabhavana Seth on the show. There was so much drama! Rakhi and I fought all the time, but there was a method to madness."***Former Bigg Boss contestant Kamya Punjabi feels it wouldn't be a surprise if one of the Indiawle wins the reality show this seasonSo just who are the contestants who’ve made a strong impression so far?Manu Punjabi  Manu Punjabi was considered too aggressive in the first week and quarreled with the other contestants over small issues. However, he has mellowed down and has become an audience favourite. He puts his points across without screaming, shouting. He’s always ready with advice and suggestions for his teammates, as well as the rivals. They listen to him and trust him as well.Manu has been bonding well with celebrity contestant Mona Lisa (Antara Biswas), who confides in him and doesn't seem to trust her own teammates like Gaurav Chopra, Rahul Dev or Bani J.Even Lopamudra was seen seeking Manu’s advice.“Who does she go to in her own team anyway, there’s nothing happening there!” Kamya observed.Manu can be very engaging and entertaining. His jests at Swami Om’s expense are hilarious. He may be a tough fighter, competitor and someone eager to win the game but he is seen as balancing these out with his fair views, understanding and bonding with teammates.His crude ways and ogling of the women when they step into the swimming pool is a major irritant.As Kamya pointed out, “Both Manu and Manveer (Gujjar) are not bad people. They don’t hold grudges against anyone when it comes to tasks. They don’t use people and they aren’t spoilsports either. They are the real entertainers. Also, when Salman asks Gaurav whether he considers Manu his competition and Gaurav says, 'Yes', Manu expresses joy. This shows that he expresses his true feelings.”***The celebrities, says TV actor Karan Wahi, have reduced their presence to that of 'background extras'Gaurav ChopraA senior television actor, Gaurav is sensible, dignified, fairly balanced and handles situations well. At times, he offers sound advice to his teammates. He’s almost a representative of the celebrity team — but then he isn’t doing nothing when it comes to providing entertainment. One does get a feeling that he is a bit insecure with his team member, Mona Lisa, mingling with the Indiawale and he has been trying to take her into confidence. But Mona, who accused Gaurav of snubbing her in front of Bigg Boss host Salman, doesn’t feel too comfortable with him. Gaurav has formed his team with Karan Mehra, Bani J and Rohan Mehra.***Karan MehraSo far, Karan is not seen much, is not vociferous about taking a stand, and appears dumbfounded by the proceedings many a times. He comes across as a gossip-monger and somebody who’s interested in flippant things. For instance, when he noticed Manu and Mona holding hands, he quickly went and mentioned it to his teammates.Kamya opined that he should have addressed his concerns to Mona herself, rather than going to Gaurav and Bani with it. “That was really very bad on his part and quite surprising as well. Instead of gossiping had he gone to Mona and told her what he felt, it was understandable. And three weeks is enough to be seen and heard. I have hardly seen him on the show,” she said.***It's time for the celebrities to up their game on Bigg Boss 10 — that's the consensusBani JBani has been a letdown on the show. She was expected to be opinionated and have a strong voice (especially since she is a former reality TV show alum, Roadies). However, over the past few days, her attitude hasn’t gone down well with viewers: She threw a tantrum after Rohan Mehra unwittingly injured her. While Rohan, who was weeping himself out ofguilt, went up to her to apologise several times, Bani refused to hear him out. Her tantrum escalated when she was ‘punished’ by Bigg Boss (along with Gaurav and Rahul) for speaking in English.“I fail to understand what Bani’s trying to do. She has been very quiet in the first week. It’s been three weeks and the real Bani still hasn’t emerged,” said Kamya.***Mona LisaMona Lisa — aka Antara Biswas — was initially compared to another Bigg Boss contestant, actress Rimi Sen. Sen too wouldn’t do much on the show and was often pulled up by Salman Khan.But Mona is now gaining confidence, especially after the secret task in which she had kiss Manu’s cheek.  In Thursday night’s episode (3 November), she exposed her teammates’ double standards and biases when they couldn’t name anyone amongst them to be sent to jail.Mona’s found support among the Indiawale and she’s become an audience favourite too. This means she could corner quite a few ‘sympathy votes’.At the same time, the celebrities are trying to woo her ‘back’ — so it’s a win-win situation for Mona.Kamya said: “Yes, Mona performed the secret task very well. That kiss to Manu was very crucial for the task. Besides the way she was treated by her team, for instance, some of them asking her whether she could understand Hindi was quite humiliating for her, which Mona has expressed.”***Om SwamiOm Swami is certainly a hypocrite and misogynist. On the one hand, he advocates Indian culture and gives lectures on parampara and labels Lokesh Kumari 'characterless' for hanging around with Rohan and getting into the pool with him. Then, he asks Lopa and Mona to clean him up in the jacuzzi as they are his ‘daasis’ and he enjoys all of that. He even dances to a Bollywood number with Mona every morning, and ogled her and Lopa when they were in the swimming pool. He’s clearly enjoying his time in the Bigg Boss house.Kamya described Swami Om as essentially “harmless”: “When he screams and people laugh at him, he understands that he’s in the wrong.”More videos from Bigg Boss 10 Comment using DisqusPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Show Comments LIVE Zimbabwe Vs Sri Lanka Live Score ZIM vs SL | Nov 6th, 2016Live Coverage SL 102 4 40.0RUNSWKTSOVERSCricket ScoresCurrent & RecentUpcomingPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 7 wickets (D/L method) Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Live Now Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Papua New Guinea beat Hong Kong by 14 runs Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 106 runs South Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS Vs SA South Africa beat Australia by 177 runs Pakistan and West Indies in UAE, 3 Test Series, 2016 PAK Vs WI West Indies beat Pakistan by 5 wickets New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ India beat New Zealand by 190 runs Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Sri Lanka beat Zimbabwe by 225 runs England in Bangladesh, 2 Test Series, 2016 BAN Vs ENG Bangladesh beat England by 108 runs New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ New Zealand beat India by 19 runs England in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 9th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 12th, 2016, 05:00 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 14th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 16th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTPakistan in New Zealand, 2 Test Series, 2016 NZ vs PAK - Nov 17th, 2016, 03:00 AM ISTEngland in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 17th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs WI - Nov 19th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 21st, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 23rd, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 24th, 2016, 09:00 AM ISTMORE STORIES FROMSeema Sinha Bigg Boss 10 Episode 21, 7th November 2016 written episode: Nominations become a game of sacrifice Bigg Boss 10, 6th November 2016 written update: Om Swami eliminated?

The contestants have to attach themselves to the bindings. The task is to keep moving without falling off. However, they don’t get individual bindings and one pair is divided for the three. Bani goes all out to win the task with her tricks. First, she gets Mona out by pushing her down and then tries to mess with Lopamudra in order to get her way, but to no avail. Navin, who is monitoring this task, tells Bigg Boss that Bani’s feet went off the bindings and since one of Lopa’s feet is still attached, she is the winner of the task. Bani tries to pull Lopa down during the task. (Colors) At the end, Lopa stands victorious and is therefore awarded immunity. Catch all the drama tonight at 10.30 on Colors.

The man, on numerous occasions has lashed out at fellow contestants like Nitibha Kaul, Bani J and of course Rohan Mehra. But this is not the only time when Navin has screamed his lungs out on national television. Many of you might not know this, but Navin, who is an UPSC-aspirant had opposed the step by UPSC to make basic English mandatory in the exam. He appeared on a few news channels too to voice his opinion, including Times Now’s The Newshour Debate, which was formerly anchored by Arnab Goswami. And guess what? He shut down Arnab on his own show. Quite a remarkable feat, we have to admit. Though he took the context to some other level altogether, he made Arnab say, “Well Spoken”. (ALSO READ: Om Swami is the most DABANGG contestant on Bigg Boss 10 this week – find out why) Reportedly, it is the same hot debate between Navin and Arnab that impressed the makers of Bigg Boss and thus earned him a place in the house this season.

One such moment that will occur on the show is when Bani J and Mona Lisa have a heart-to-heart. The wake-up song for the contestants will be the famous track Mere Piya Gaye Rangoon, which will convince Bani and Mona that they are going to get phone calls from their family members. Bani will be seen rehearsing her phone call with her mom, who isn't particularly happy with her daughter being on the show. Bani even recalls getting messages of love from her mom and how much she cares about her. Mona then tells her how they were talking just for fun and suddenly it turned into a very emotional moment for the two and they end up breaking down revealing how much they miss their family.

Rohan Mehra insists that he wants to help Manoj to arrange his clothes and after a lot of pleading, Manoj agrees. But Nitibha gets annoyed with Rohan because he was taking his role too far. Maharaj (Swami Om) enjoys all the attention as he bathes in swimming pool and all the Sevaks perform his ‘Rajya Abhishek’.

Bigg Boss 10 poll: Who should be evicted from the show this week? | tv | Hindustan Times follow us: epaper india world cities opinion sports entertainment lifestyle tech photos videos more... us presidential election breathless in delhi ht long reads bigg boss 10 movie reviews ht paathshala Bigg Boss 10 poll: Who should be evicted from the show this week? HT Correspondent, Hindustan Times, New Delhi | Updated: Nov 01, 2016 15:04 IST Here are some reasons why you should or shouldn’t vote for the contestants. Check them out and then take our poll at the end of this story to let us know who you’d want to kick out . (Colors) It’s that time of the week again! Time to vote for the contestant you want to see thrown out of the Bigg Boss house this weekend. The fates of seven contestants will be decided this time: Mona Lisa, Lopamudra, Nitibha, Bani, Manu, Om Swami ji and Manveer. We tell you why you should or shouldn’t vote for them. Don’t forget to take our poll to let us know who you would want kicked out of the show. 1. Mona Lisa (Colors) Everyone thinks she is good at heart but her heart doesn’t seem to be in the game. Is it reason enough to say goodbye to her? 2. Lopamudra (Colors) She did call out Swami Ji’s bluff when she revealed that while he was telling everybody that he doesn’t want to stay in the house anymore, he was also sneakily asking the audience to vote out Manu and Manveer instead. Counts as one good deed. Don’t you think? 3. Nitibha Teammates are accusing her of meddling in other people’s businesses. Is that an irritating thing to do? 4. Bani (Colors) Bani wants to keep the toughest competitors in the game till the end so she can have a good time. But no one else thought the same and decided to nominate her. Does her sportsmanship deserve a second chance? 5. Manu (Colors) While some feel Manu is a ‘strong competitor’, many others say he is trying to manipulate his teammates. Whatever the reason, Manu remained a favourite for another round of nominations. 6. Manveer (Colors) Most Bigg Boss contestants feel that Manveer is a threat to them. No wonder he was nominated for the eviction again. 7. Om Swamiji (Colors) A lot of contestants are fed up of Om Swamiji’s behaviour. Are you too? Take our poll: Who do you want to see kicked out of the Bigg Boss House this week?

As a result, celebrities gain the position ofThe celebrities had a secret task where they had to capture the Indiawale in 12 orchestrated moments, and despite the odds, pulled off the challenge. As a result, celebrities gain the position of 'maaliks' and earn some respite from being the 'sevaks' for three weeks in a row now.  and thus get respite from being 'Sevaks' for three weeks in a row. However, the celebrities went too far in winning the task, at times under the guise of pampering Om Swami, or Mona Lisa showering affection on Manu by planting a kiss on his cheek.From Bigg Boss 10, episode 17 3rd November 2016However, the celebrities went too far in their quest to win, under the guise of pampering Om Swami, or Mona Lisa showering affection on Manu by planting a kiss on his cheek. No wonder when the details about the secret task were revealed to the 'Indiawale', they were stumped. Manu, in particular, seems shocked that Mona's kiss was planned. The celebrities were seen rejoicing over their win while Om Swami, who doesn’t like losing, is deeply unhappy.Click here to watch Bigg Boss Season 10, 2nd November 2016 Full Episode powered by Voot Meanwhile, the luxury budget task wherein the Indiawale are playing the royals and the celebrities their subjects, continued -- with several fights. On the second day of the luxury budget task., we find the Indiawale (Om Swami and the other 'royals') grumpy after a night spent in the living room, attempting to protect their 'kingdom'.  A vexed Manveer points out that Swami’s insecurity ensured the 'karamcharis' (the celebrities' team) a good night's rest.Meanwhile, Rohan insists that he wants to help Manoj put his clothes and after a lot of pleading, Manoj agrees. But, Nitibha gets annoyed with Rohan because (she feels) he’s taking his role too far. Manoj believes that Rohan is playing a game by showering the men with attention, but remains unperturbed by it.Om Swami, as usual, is the focus of negative publicity thanks to his misogynistic statements and threats. And now, Bigg Boss 10 too seems to be milking his infamy for all it's worth. So the 'sevaks' (celebs) give Om Swami a grand bath: First in the pool, and then a bath with milk, and finally a bubble bath in the jacuzzi where Lopa Mudra and Mona Lisa help him out. Well, there was a hidden agenda here because under the guise of all this, the celebrities accomplished a lot of secret tasks, without anyone doubting their intentions.Making the task more interesting was Om Swami’s rajya abhishek ceremony planned by the 'Indiawale'. The celebrities readily agree because it gives them an opportunity to complete their secret task. Just to annoy Lopa, Nitibha orders her to bring her crown for this ceremony, but Lopa flatly refuses. In fact, she tells Navin and Manoj that she has earned the crown with her own hard work and cannot just hand it over to someone for a task. The rajya abhishek ceremony finally comes to a close with Nitibha crowning the king and everyone leading him back to his throne.Among the other highlights is Rohan prompting Lokesh to 'escape' the house as 'people will not accept their love'. He takes her to the swimming pool, saying he's willing to jump in for her sake. But at the last minute, Rohan slips away while Bani pushes Lokesh into the pool. When Om Swami gets to know about this, he gets really annoyed with both Lokesh and Rohan and decides to punish them. A lot of the contestants believe that Om Swami has taken his character from the task too far and is disrespecting the contestants and they bring it up with him.Some drama occurs when Bani J suddenly loses her cool during the luxury budget task. Rohan unwittingly hurts Bani, and she bleeds. Bani lashes out at her teammates to leave her alone. As Rohan begins to cry out of guilt, the others calm him down, pointing out that it was just an accident.  We later find out that Bani was worried the injury might mar her tattoo. The reason behind Bani’s outburst was her worry that the injury could hamper her tattoo. And towards the end, as Bigg Boss announces that one memberTowards the end of the episode, Bigg Boss announces that one member of each team will be going to jail, and arguments and fights start once again.Related NewsBigg Boss 10 Episode 23, 8 November 2016: No more malik, sevaks; all contestants mergeBigg Boss 10 Episode 21, 7th November 2016 written episode: Nominations become a game of sacrifice Comment using DisqusPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Show Comments LIVE Zimbabwe Vs Sri Lanka Live Score ZIM vs SL | Nov 6th, 2016Live Coverage SL 102 4 40.0RUNSWKTSOVERSCricket ScoresCurrent & RecentUpcomingPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 7 wickets (D/L method) Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Live Now Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Papua New Guinea beat Hong Kong by 14 runs Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 106 runs South Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS Vs SA South Africa beat Australia by 177 runs Pakistan and West Indies in UAE, 3 Test Series, 2016 PAK Vs WI West Indies beat Pakistan by 5 wickets New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ India beat New Zealand by 190 runs Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Sri Lanka beat Zimbabwe by 225 runs England in Bangladesh, 2 Test Series, 2016 BAN Vs ENG Bangladesh beat England by 108 runs New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ New Zealand beat India by 19 runs England in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 9th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 12th, 2016, 05:00 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 14th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 16th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTPakistan in New Zealand, 2 Test Series, 2016 NZ vs PAK - Nov 17th, 2016, 03:00 AM ISTEngland in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 17th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs WI - Nov 19th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 21st, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 23rd, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 24th, 2016, 09:00 AM ISTMORE STORIES FROMSeema Sinha Bigg Boss 10 Episode 21, 7th November 2016 written episode: Nominations become a game of sacrifice Bigg Boss 10, 6th November 2016 written update: Om Swami eliminated?

As a fresh day dawned to ‘Pak Chik Pak Raja Babu’, it brought with it the anticipation of the looming luxury budget task. While waiting for it to be announced, Swami ji plotted with Manu, Manveer and Navin about how to tackle the task this week maintaining a united front. Meanwhile on the celebrity side, Karan turned peacemaker between Lopamudra and Bani and tried to ease the tension created due to the nomination process. Bigg Boss introduced the luxury budget task – a costume drama titled ‘Raja aur Rank’. In keeping with the flavour of the task, the Indiawale and celebrities transformed themselves into various characters belonging to a royal family. While the Indiawale got regal status and got to emulate members of a royal family, the celebrities were their obedient staff and subjects throughout the duration of the task. In order to help them get into the skin of their respective characters, Bigg Boss supplied the housemates with special costumes which they had to wear for the task. But, in a twist of fate, the celebrities got an opportunity to turn tables on the Indiawale through a secret task where they had to capture the Indiawale in 12 moments orchestrated by the celebrities. As the task began, the Indiawale faced a tough time in taking advantage of the celebrities especially with Om Swami and Nitibha’s constant bickering over the rules of the game. Even Manveer got tired of Nitibha’s endless taunting and ended up getting into a screaming match with her. Even Navin finds himself at the receiving end of Nitibha’s temper and finds himself side-lined in the process. Swami ji ends up taking his role of a king too seriously, thereby annoying even his fellow royal family members. Scared of losing the task, Manu took charge and attempted to bring some method to the madness. Manu’s day got better thereafter, when his closest friend Mona Lisa surprises him with a kiss on his cheek.While Gaurav slowly and steadily pushed the celebrities to complete the secret task, Manu and Manveer found him too pushy and try to get him put in jail under false accusations. But Gaurav smoothly escaped the punishment. Rahul, on the other hand, was not as lucky and his actions around King Swami landed him in jail. When Bigg Boss supplied the celebrities with paints and massage oil to fuel the luxury budget task, Rohan found himself in jail for misbehaving with Nitibha while painting Swamiji’s picture. And, as Lopamudra approached Manveer with the massage oil, her intentions were misunderstood resulting in a battle of words between the two. The luxury budget task has brought new hostilities inside the Bigg Boss house. Will the celebrities be able to turn tables on the Indiawale or will they fail at their secret task?

It is Salman Khan weekend on Bigg Boss 10. But it is also the eviction time of the week. And considering there is a big group of contestants who have been nominated, it might just be as confusing for the viewers to make a choice, as it is to understand the fights inside the house. The Weekend ka Vaar episode will reveal the name of the second eliminated person from the house. But if audience response is to be considered, we know the name of the contestant who might exit Bigg Boss 10 this week — Akanksha Sharma! Akanksha stirred enough controversy when she entered the house during its premiere night on October 16. And after spending two weeks on the show, there is a strong possibility that she is the one whose journey on the reality show will end this time. Others who were nominated this week were Manveer Gurjar, Manoj Punjabi, Rohan Mehra, Gaurav Chopra, Nitibha Kaul, Om Swami and Mona Lisa. To know the choice of the audience, as to whom they wish to save, we conducted a Twitter poll. And Akanksha got 37 per cent votes, the maximum of the total 192 votes. While Manveer Gurjar got 26 per cent, Manu Punjabi got 24 per cent and Nitibha Kaul got 13 per cent. #BiggBoss10 : Who should be evicted from commoners in week 2? — IE entertainment (@ieEntertainment) October 27, 2016 See pictures | Bigg Boss 10, 28th October highlights: Contestants receive emotional gifts from family on Diwali Akanksha was married to cricketer Yuvraj Singh’s brother Zorawar. But barely a year after their wedding, the two got separated, and are currently in the process of a divorce. Hence, whatever Akanksha spoke about her in-laws during her stay in the Bigg Boss house were rather shocking for the audience. And in the outside world, Akanksha’s mother-in-law Shabnam Singh and estranged husband Zorawar have been lashing out at Akanksha and how it is against the legal process. If Akanksha does get evicted this week, it needs to be seen how she will take all the criticism from her in-laws about her personal life.

Bigg Boss 10: Om Swamiji is back in the jail | tv | Hindustan Times follow us: epaper india world cities opinion sports entertainment lifestyle tech photos videos more... us presidential election breathless in delhi ht long reads bigg boss 10 movie reviews ht paathshala Bigg Boss 10: Om Swamiji is back in the jail HT Correspondent, Hindustan Times, New Delhi | Updated: Oct 27, 2016 17:29 IST When the commoners are discussing who should be sent to the hail, Manu says, “Jab bhi jail jana hoga, Om Swamiji his jayenge.” On Wednesday’s episode, we saw the commoners winning the task. They are back as the ‘maliks’ of the Bigg Boss house. Thursday’s episode will see two commoners competing for immunity from the next nominations. It is also time for two others to go to the jail! When Bigg Boss asks housemates to name one contestant each from their teams whose performance was not upto the mark. Om Swami refuses to go to the jail. He retorts that he has already been there once and won’t go again. But Manu stresses that every time a contestant had to go to jail from their team, it will be him. Om Swami is upset about this and cribs about injustice inflicted upon him. Manveer loses his cool at this and charges towards Swami ji. A heated argument ensues between the two. Eventually, Swamiji is sent to jail. One of the celebs is also sent there. Bigg Boss then asks the commoners to elect two strong contenders who contributed maximum to the laundry task and Lokesh and Navin emerge as the two contenders. Bigg Boss then allots a set of blocks (dominos) to each housemate and both Navin and Lokesh have to impress them and collect the set of blocks from them to create a straight line. The one with maximum number of dominos standing in a straight line will be declared as the winner of the task. The winner will be immune from next week’s nominations for eviction. Lokesh tries to impress celebrities and other Indiawale by preparing food for them and entertaining them thus winning most of the votes in her favour. When Navin realizes that Lokesh is ahead of him, he engages her in a conversation and destroys her blocks. As Lokesh sees her blocks tumbling and falling on the ground, she becomes furious and lashes out at Navin for sabotaging her task.

And after a luxury budget task (the laundry challenge that nearly had them at wits end, the contestants are back to having a more relaxed time. Of course, that doesn't mean they're off duty when it comes to smaller tasks or the usual nomination-related politics.So here's what's in store for episode 11 of Bigg Boss 10:The Indiawale enjoy their victoryAfter winning the luxury budget and becoming the maliks of the house, Indiawale bask in the glory of their success. On the other hand, the celebrities take their defeat with a pinch of salt hoping to reverse it soon. In retrospect, Indiawale discuss how they won the task with hard work and determination but Om Swami dismisses everything and claims that it all happened because of his blessings and prayers. While cleaning the beds, Bani finds lots of dirty tissue papers littered around the common bed and accuses the Indiawale of being unhygienic. Offended by Bani’s comment, Nitibha confronts her and says that she was being very nasty and it was not required.Fights break out among the IndiawaleNext morning...Next morning, the contestants wake up dancing to the tunes of ‘I Am The Best’. A guilty Swamiji apologises to Gaurav Chopra for nominating him and says that he did so because he considers him a tough contender. Gaurav says there's no need to apologise, as this is just a game. Later in the day, Bigg Boss asks the housemates to gather in the living area and tells them to nominate two weaklings from their respective teams who underperformed in the task and deserve to go to the jail.So who gets sent to jail?After a lot of discussion and arguments, the celebrities elect Mona while the Indiawale elect Swami Om. Mona and Swamiji, however, do not agree with their respective team’s decision and refuse to go to the jail. Mona breaks into tears as she feels that her team is being unfair and targeting her unnecessarily. When Swamiji sings the same tune, Manveer lashes out at him and tells him that he contributed the least in the task and has no right to object the team’s decision.And who gets to compete for immunity?In the evening, Bigg Boss asks Indiawale to elect two strong contenders who contributed the most in the luxury budget task — to compete for immunity. Lokesh and Navin are selected. As a part of the task, Bigg Boss allots a set of dominoes to each housemate while both Navin and Lokesh have to impress them and collect the set of blocks to create a straight line. The one with the most number of dominoes standing upright in a straight line will be declared as the winner of the task.Lokesh tries to impress celebrities and other Indiawale by preparing parathas and entertaining them, thus getting most of the votes. When Navin realises that Lokesh is leading and is close to winning the task, he engages her in a conversation and then destroys her row of dominoes. As Lokesh finds her dominoes have fallen, she is furious and lashes out at Navin for sabotaging her efforts. Lokesh breaks into tears as Navin tells her that it is just a task and he is playing a game.So who wins immunity, and do Mona and Swami Om go to jail?

Reacting to the allegations made by Akansha, Yuvraj’s mom Shabnam Singh has told Hindustan Times, “First of all, this matter is sub judice and she (Akansha) is not allowed to speak. It goes under the contempt of court. There’s a special petition I had filed. Anyone can understand the agenda here and everybody knows it. We are not allowed to speak on this matter.” Akansha’s eviction leaves 12 contestants inside the Bigg Boss house: commoner contestants Nitibha Kaul, Manoj Manu Punjabi, Manveer Gurjar, Lokesh Kumari Sharma, Om Swami and celeb participants VJ Bani, Karan Mehra, Rohan Mehra, Rahul Dev, Gaurav Chopra, Lopamudra Raut and Monalisa. Bigg Boss is scripted on the lines of the British television show Big Brother. The show’s format keeps participants locked inside a house for three months with no access to the outside world.

Yes, Akansha, who grabbed the headlines for openly speaking about the troubles in her marriage with the very popular Indian cricketer Yuvraj Singh’s younger brother Zorawar is out of the house and the most affected of all’s commoner Nitibha Kaul as the two got along very well on the show.Akanksha caught the viewers’ attention right from the beginning when she blamed her mother-in-law, Shabnam Singh for her failed marriage. She also confided in her fellow contestant, Gaurav Chopra and claimed that the Singh family made her starve for money and it was a struggle to get Rs 3,000 a month. All this had irked Shabnam who came out in the open and made some counter-allegations on Akanksha.Salman Khan with Bharti Singh and Karan Wahi.Earlier, Salman flagged off tonight's episode on a sweet note as he danced with young kids to a mashup of ‘Aaj Ki Party’ and ‘Happy Diwali’ numbers. He then proceeded to hand out gifts to his dance crew, while revealing that the children are actually from an orphanage. Meanwhile, Salman continued cracking jokes on Om Swami and came up with about half a dozen alternate career options for him to select while showcasing a montage. He further introduced two games - The Laddoo game and The Thappad game before setting a festive mood. While the laddoo game enabled the contestants to choose the one whose presence could be avoided in the Bigg Boss house, the thappad game revealed the biggest liars amongst the contestants.In the thappad task, the contestants are made to sit solo in a dark room and were asked questions by Bigg Boss. For every wrong answer, they get slapped. Contestants like Gaurav Chopra, Manu Punjabi, Lopamudra Raut and Navin Prakash get slapped for their wrong answers. For instance, when Gaurav disagrees that he's not the mastermind behind all the celebrities, he is slapped by the Bigg Boss as the contestants don’t agree with him.Joining Salman Ki Sabha was a panel of three housewives from different cities  and they were seen sharing their opinions about the performance of the celebrities and Indiawale in the show and reveal who, according to them, was a mastermind in the game . They unanimously felt that the celebrities were being too careful, dignified, well-behaved and image conscious whereas the commoners or the Indiawale were completely opposite of the celebrities and as a result were playing the game very well.Commenting upon Mona Lisa’s relations with her own teammates, the trio felt that she was being discriminated and she seemed to be more compatible with the commoners and as a result Manu Punjabi was taking advantage of the situation. They felt that Manu, Manveer Gurjar and Karan Mehra were smart players whereas Gaurav was a dull personality.After all the discussion, these housewives decide that it's time to have some fun as they give Salman a task where he needs to become a pani puri wala. Salman accepts their special request and feeds them some scrumptious and delicious pani puri.Later, on the show, the Mona's issue is being discussed by both the groups separately. While Mona, Manu and Manveer talk among themselves, the celebrities call Manu 'cheap'. Gaurav specifically points out that Manu stating that since she's is not very comfortable with her own teammates and hence she joins commoners, and that they like her company, was a cheap remark.The night then takes a humorous turn as comedy queen Bharti Singh makes an appearance along with her partner Karan Wahi to entertain the contestants with their comical gags and fiery jabs. None of the contestants are spared, especially Om Swami as Bharti and Karan joke about his 100-crore film undertaking. Being a total sport, Om Swami shakes a leg to Salman Khan's song ‘Baby Ko Bass Pasand Hai’ when Bharti urges him to do so.And soon, it was Lokesh Kumari's turn as Karan Wahi makes her audition to be the new host of Comedy Nights Bachao Tazaa but Lokesh forgets her lines! But, upon hearing Lokesh's voice, Bharti makes a keen observation; compares her voice to the indomitable Rakhi Sawant!  The duo even grill the first week evictee Priyanka Jagga. From calling her a 'walking-talking-mooli' to pointing out Priyanka's absurd behaviour,  Bharti leaves no stone unturned in poking fun at the loud-mouthed lady.  The volley of gags at Priyanka only intensifies as Bharti reveals that Priyanka Chopra is now looking to change her name, lest she be misunderstood as Madam Jagga!Related NewsBigg Boss 10 Episode 23, 8 November 2016: No more malik, sevaks; all contestants mergeBigg Boss 10 Episode 21, 7th November 2016 written episode: Nominations become a game of sacrifice Comment using DisqusPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Show Comments LIVE Zimbabwe Vs Sri Lanka Live Score ZIM vs SL | Nov 6th, 2016Live Coverage SL 102 4 40.0RUNSWKTSOVERSCricket ScoresCurrent & RecentUpcomingPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 7 wickets (D/L method) Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Live Now Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Papua New Guinea beat Hong Kong by 14 runs Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 106 runs South Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS Vs SA South Africa beat Australia by 177 runs Pakistan and West Indies in UAE, 3 Test Series, 2016 PAK Vs WI West Indies beat Pakistan by 5 wickets New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ India beat New Zealand by 190 runs Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Sri Lanka beat Zimbabwe by 225 runs England in Bangladesh, 2 Test Series, 2016 BAN Vs ENG Bangladesh beat England by 108 runs New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ New Zealand beat India by 19 runs England in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 9th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 12th, 2016, 05:00 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 14th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 16th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTPakistan in New Zealand, 2 Test Series, 2016 NZ vs PAK - Nov 17th, 2016, 03:00 AM ISTEngland in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 17th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs WI - Nov 19th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 21st, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 23rd, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 24th, 2016, 09:00 AM ISTMORE STORIES FROMSeema Sinha Bigg Boss 10 Episode 23, 8 November 2016: No more malik, sevaks; all contestants merge Bigg Boss 10, episode 19, 4th November 2016 Written Update: Friction flares between Bani and Lopa Bigg Boss 10, episode 18, 3rd November 2016 Written Episode: Gaurav, Bani, Rahul punished for rule-breaking Shah Rukh Khan’s birthday: Is Raees the reason for actor not hosting his usual party?

She's however happy to be back with her family. Parmita Uniyal  | Posted by Anvita Singh parmita.uniyal@intoday.com October 31, 2016 | UPDATED 11:36 IST A +A -Former Bigg Boss contestant Akansha Sharma. Picture courtesy: YouTubeAkanksha Sharma, the former sister-in-law of cricketer Yuvraj Singh, became the second contestant to get eliminated on Sunday. The aam aadmi contestant kept a low profile in the house, as "she doesn't believe in picking fights without a reason." She made friends in the house among celebs, but couldn't connect with aam aadmi contestants. If given a chance, Akanksha would like to re-enter the house but her strategy would remain the same. In an exclusive conversation with India Today Online, Akanksha shared her experience in the Bigg Boss house, revealed her favourite contestants, and the contestant she loathed.Also read:Bigg Boss 10: Yuvraj Singh's former sis-in-law Akanksha Sharma gets evictedIndia Today Online: How was your experience in the Bigg Boss 10 house? You are out of the house in Week 2.  Disappointed?Akanksha Sharma: It was once in a lifetime experience for me; it was amazing. I was very comfortable being watched by everybody since I have done an acting course, and I wasn't afraid of facing the camera. I am very happy because it was a good experience and also because I'm going to see my family. I am also a little disappointed in myself that in these two weeks, I couldn't show who I am on the show. It's ok, I guess, it's a part of life. India Today Online: Compared to the other aam aadmi contestants you were keeping a low profile.Akanksha Sharma: I think for them, it was a very new experience. For the first time they were in a zone where they were being watched. It was probably the excitement that made them react more. I am not that loud in reacting to situations. When it comes to voicing my opinion, I don't stop myself. But then there were characters like Om baba and I just couldn't compete at that level, just for TRPs.India Today Online: You made news for all the wrong reasons. You troubled Bani J with a smelly sock and stole clothes in laundry task. A lot of housemates also thought that you are different from what you appear to be.There's a twist in the nomination process, members from the same team to be nominated tonight! #BB10pic.twitter.com/hIWUyQur9qâ€” Bigg Boss (@BiggBoss) October 31, 2016Akanksha Sharma: I don't think they really got to know the real me. Mona Lisa was the one who said that I am different from what I appear. But we got along fine after that. I couldn't connect with common people all these days because my school of thought was different from theirs.  I was able to connect with celebs more. I used to contribute my 100% to my team during the tasks. As far as stealing the clothes is concerned, even Lopa did the same. Healthy cheating is fine. If I'm not hurting anybody, it should be ok. In the other task (smelly sock), I apologized to Bani the very next moment. I felt very bad that I did it because it was something that I did in the heat of the moment, masti masti mein. I have sorted out things with Bani. I don't hold anything against her. In fact, I enjoyed connecting with her. My friends were mostly celebs.India Today Online: Is this the reason why you shared a special bond with Gaurav Chopra? Is something cooking between you two?Akanksha Sharma: No, there is nothing between the two of us. We just used to talk like normal people. We were just friends. I am not attracted to him, if that's what you are asking.India Today Online: While you entered the house, post sharing your story, your former mother-in-law said that you were doing it for publicity and that it could account for a contempt of court. What do you have to say on this?Akanksha Sharma: I came to know this only now. I have only shared what had happened with me and I think I have the right to share that. One should not tolerate what is wrong. There are a lot of people who do not speak when they undergo something like this. I wanted to set an example that you can be in control of the situation. You should stand up and speak for yourself. I know a lot of things about their family and I know they are scared that I might reveal it. India Today Online: Who do you think will win the show this time?Akanksha Sharma: I am praying for my friend Nitibha. And I am also supporting Lokesh a lot. I really like that girl and I support her story. I really want her to win. And if somebody needs it and deserves it, it is her.India Today Online: Was there somebody in the house, you did not like at all?Akanksha Sharma: It is Om baba. I am surprised that people follow him and believe him. I am against this ki kapde pahanne se koi baba ban jaata hai. People believe in these superstitions even now. I didn't like Om baba one bit because wo  bolte kuch the karte kuch aur the. He never contributed in tasks. And he never supported us. There are people in the house who trust him. But he's just manipulating them. India Today Online: Who's the smartest player? Akanksha Sharma: Definitely Om baba. Before nominations, he used to bitch about the opposite team and his attitude would change on the day of nominations. He can do anything to win. He sometimes did things, just for grabbing more eyeballs. "Wo bolte the, maine isliye aisa kiya jisse TRP badhe." India Today Online: Will you re-enter the show as wild card entry, if given a choice?Akanksha Sharma:  I would definitely love to enter as wild card entry if given a choice. I would have a better perspective after watching everything from outside.  For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in. ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.  # Bigg Boss 10# Lokesh# Akansha Sharma# Gaurav Chopra# eviction   May we RecommendWatch Right NowTop TakesNEWSINDIAWORLDPHOTOSCRICKETMOVIESAUTOSPORTSLIFESTYLETECHEDUCATIONBUSINESSSITEMAPCopyright © 2016 Living Media India Limited.

Two commoners got evicted from the show in a row.

She says she is only looking for a divorce now and feels Shabnam Singh -- mother of the star cricketer -- is afraid of what she might tell the world about the family.Akanksha was married to Yuvraj's younger brother Zoravar for four months. However, the couple has been estranged for over two years now.Before Akanksha entered the Bigg Boss house earlier this month, she had said that her problems were not between her and Zoravar, or with Yuvraj, but with their mother Shabnam, who hit out by saying that Akanksha perhaps had an "agenda" to enter the show.Asked about her opinion about Shabnam's statement, Akanksha told IANS, "I think she is afraid of the fact that the things that I have to say are quite true, because if things aren't true, a person doesn't really react the way she is reacting to it. You are (She is) afraid of what I might say."Akanksha said she is "not looking for anything" from the Singh family."But (I am) looking for my divorce and I don't want anything from their house at all. I just want my freedom from that house. I want to go ahead in my life," she added.The Gurgaon-based girl, post her ouster from Bigg Boss, has been quoted by a publication as saying that she was forced into intimacy with Zoravar and that she smoked pot with him.Shabnam has now released a statement against these allegations made by Akanksha."Me and my family have only knocked the doors of the courts against her false allegations and blackmailing. I deny all these new allegations as well. The matter is sub-judice and I hope every one else also respects the law of land and let the courts bring out the truth through their verdict," Shabnam said in a statement."For the longest time, we as a family have ignored all her unnecessary assaults, giving her the benefit of being a woman, of being immature, and above all of being family. This benefit cannot be extended forever," she added.Yuvraj's mother -- now "determined to take this to its logical end" -- also said "the image of the family assiduously earned over a period of years, cannot be allowed to be eroded by an ill-meaning person".Meanwhile, the Bigg Boss journey was "pretty awesome" for Akanksha, who has described it as a "once in a lifetime experience"."I wasn't expecting it, but the day the eviction was taking place, I kind of felt it that it is going to happen because I really didn't get the chance to show who I am or represent who I am," she said.After Bigg Boss, she is looking forward to acting and finishing her book on woman empowerment.You Might Also LikeRecommended By Colombia From around the webMore from Mumbai MirrorRecommended By Colombia GALLERIESShah Rukh Khan’s rare photos ...Where are the Bonds today?B-Town gears up for Durga Puj...CorneredMumbai says goodbye to Lord G...Celebrities say 'Ganpati Bapp...The fashionable week that was...The best of LFW 2016Food fetishCM KCR felicitates Sindhu's g...It's World Photography DayPutting the bizarre in Break-...Most ReadTODAYTHIS WEEKMONTHALL TIME Across Mumbai Mirror >>Saif Ali Khan’s daughter set to debut i...

So here is a handy list of all the highlights from the episode. Do take our poll at the end and let us know which one you thought was the most interesting. 1. Bani does not like getting stabbed by knives And we understand. Rohan was playing around with knives, waving them around in the air when he accidentally stabbed Bani a little on the right side of her waist. She started bleeding instantly though not very severely. She got really angry at Rohan’s stupidity, demanding how he could be so careless with dangerous objects. Of course, Rohan felt extremely sorry and even apologised to Bani. She forgave him soon enough, perhaps sensing genuine guilt in his voice. He even shed a few tears! Aw Rohan don’t cry! Your girls fans won’t like to see you like this. (COLORS) Even Bigg Boss’ voice boomed through the house, telling Rohan that what he did was very careless indeed and that everyone should be more careful in the future. 2. Celebrity team wins the secret task Look at them, they are the captains now. (COLORS) The celebrity team successfully completed the secret task and were able to restore power again. They got all the pictures that Bigg Boss asked them to click during the task including the one in which Mona kissed Manu, and the one in which Bani pushed Lokesh into the pool and more. Watch out Lokesh! (COLORS) The other team spent a good, long time wondering how they could have pulled this off. 3. Lopa and Nitibha fight and make up These girls need to calm down. (COLORS) Nitibha and Lopamudra got in a heated war of words when Lopa failed to give the commoner team their food on time. Her explanation for her failure didn’t go down well with Nitibha, resulting in yet another fight. Take our poll now : Bigg Boss 10: Which of these was your favourite moment from the episode?

One thing that has come to notice is that whenever Rohan is around Lokesh, she can’t seem to stop smiling and gushing. (ALSO READ: Bigg Boss 10: Bani J stuns Mona Lisa and Manveer Gurjar with her hot body and kickass workout – watch video) In the past weeks, it has been evident that whenever someone has spoken ill about Rohan, Lokesh always takes his side and has defended him. Now yesterday, celebs played a task in which contestants were asked questions about each other. So it is during this task, Manveer was asked that who would Rohan go on a date with from the BB house. Manveer thought that Rohan would take Lopamudra Raut’s name because of the comfort level which they both share, but surprisingly the Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai fame named Lokesh and said that the only person who he would like to date is Lokesh. Awww, so cute. We wonder what Kanchi Singh (Rohan’s girlfriend and his YRKK co-star) has to say about this?

November 4, 2016 Ankita Bhalla 66233 reads 0 comments How can the Bigg Boss be devoid of any romance of sorts? Looks like, the love season is about to kickstart in BB house. While Manu Punjabi and Mona Lisa's attraction did move ahead a bit, the story went kaput in a few days. Mona was more interested in friend zoning Manu, who is already touted to be engaged to a Jaipur-based girl, Priya. Moving on, there might be a budding romance in the house! In today's episode celebs will play a task where contestants will be asked questions about each other. While celebrity Rohan will be questioned about commoner Manveer Gujjar, so it will be vice-versa. Here each contestant will tell their perception about their housemates. So Manveer will be asked that who would Rohan go on a date with from the BB house. As per Manveer, Lopamudra Raut will be the one whom Rohan will choose. Reason - the comfort level which both Rohan-Lopa share with each other; be it working out together to Lopa consoling Rohan when he accidentally stabbed Bani J. However, the answered will turn out to be wrong! Wonder why... Because Rohan will then reveal that the person he will go out with will be commoner Lokesh Kumari, because the only person in the house who will like to 'date' will be her! Do we smell something fishy...? For the uninitiated, Rohan has been open about his GF in real life, Kanchi Singh, the Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai co-stars.

Prarthna Sarkar November 3, 2016 15:28 IST Rohan Mehra, Lokesh Kumari on Bigg Boss 10.Bigg Boss/ TwitterAfter Manu Punjabi and Monalisa, Rohan Mehra and Lokesh Kumari seem to be getting close on Bigg Boss 10. However, it is too soon to judge if the contestants are just being friendly or making advances for staying in the news. Mehra was sent to jail for misbehaving with fellow inmate Nitibha Kaul, but Kumari pleaded Om Swami to let the Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai actor walk-free. Although, the act impressed Mehra, Kumar's teammates were unhappy. Why advertise with us?

Viewers have reacted to the new chemistry that's building between Mehra and Kumari. Some have even said they come across as a better "pair" than Punjabi and Monalisa. But the interesting bit is, both the two men who are being romantically paired with their co-participants have partners outside the house. Kanchi Singh, Mehra's girlfriend, posted an adorable message the day after BB10 was first aired. She tweeted: "So he is finally in the bigg boss house! Want ur immense support! @rohan4747 do win n come! Best wishes." Meanwhile, Priya Saini, Punjabi's fiancée, said he will fight his own battles inside the house and come out stronger. "He has this habit of getting into any fight or argument, even if it has got nothing to do with him. Also, he is obsessed with cleanliness. Ab yeh dekhna hai ki woh Bigg Boss house mein kaise survive karte hain," India Forums quoted her as saying. In other news, Priyanka Jagga and Akansha Sharma have been evicted so far.

The reality show, an Indian version of international series "Celebrity Big Brother", features celebrities locked inside a house for three months under constant camera surveillance, without any gadgets or luxury. This time the spotlight is on the common man. READ ALSO: Bigg Boss 10: Guess who according to Lopamudra Raut is the hottest male contestant in the house? According to a source close to the show, Bani and Manveer have become friends in the past three weeks and are often seen spending time with each other. "Be it analysing their performance in a task after its completion or just catching up on the day's affairs, Manveer and Bani have been spotted spending quality time with each other too many times," said the source. In the Appy Fizz ‘Feel The Fizz' luxury budget task, which will air on Friday, contestants had to fill questionnaires about their perceptions of fellow contestants. "When it came down to Bani, Manveer was asked who according to Bani was the hottest male contestant and while he guessed it to be Gaurav, the response hit too close to home when she said that the answer was Manveer," said the source.

Priyanka Jagga might be out of the Bigg Boss 10 house, but she continues to hog headlines. While she came across as a trouble-maker on the show, her shocking eviction in the very first week left the audience desperate to know more about this commoner. While we told you sometime back that Priyanka is a well-known face in Delhi’s Page 3 circuit and has a Canadian husband, there is more to the mother of two. According to DNA, Priyanka’s former boyfriend Gautam Arora made some startling revelations about the 32-year-old. He said Priyanka is separated from her husband Timothy Muise for the past 3-4 years. That’s not all. All her claims about her perfect marriage and the episode of Karva Chauth inside the house was just a cover-up for her personal life. WATCH: Bigg Boss 10 26th October Review: This Episode Is All About Fights Gautam is a DJ and an actor. He met Priyanka in 2013 at the launch of a club in Delhi’s Dwarka. The two dated for around five months, before parting ways. Clearing the air around dozens of pictures Priyanka keeps sharing on her social media accounts with her husband, Gautam said they are all old pictures as the two are not together now. “Priyanka has been separated from her husband for three to four years. He moved abroad leaving her behind with the kids. I met her at the launch of Asom Club in Dwarka. We got friendly and dated for four to five months. I left her as I did not like her partying ways. She was only after money. Moreover, she had many friends”, he said. Priyanka Jagga was the first contestant to be evicted from the television reality show Bigg Boss 10. Gautam knew about Priyanka’s plan of participating in Bigg Boss 10. He claimed that he was the one who helped her get through. He added, “She can do anything for money. Obviously, she did not know anyone in the industry and took my help to give the auditions.” According to Gautam, Priyanka is not a marketing consultant as her profiles state. She is actually into event management in Delhi, and all the claims that she is a struggling actor are also untrue. She has many fake accounts with fake information, he claimed.

Bigg Boss 10: I don’t want to go back to the house, says Priyanka Jagga | tv | Hindustan Times follow us: epaper india world cities opinion sports entertainment lifestyle tech photos videos more... us presidential election breathless in delhi ht long reads bigg boss 10 movie reviews ht paathshala Bigg Boss 10: I don’t want to go back to the house, says Priyanka Jagga HT Correspondent, Hindustan Times, New Delhi | Updated: Oct 26, 2016 14:25 IST Priyanka Jagga was the first one to be voted out of the tenth season of ongoing reality show Bigg Boss. Priyanka Jagga, who was voted out of the ongoing reality show Bigg Boss 10 in the first week, is back in the news. Rumours of late claimed she might be soon back inside the house on a wild card entry, but the 32-year-old marketing recruiter put all speculations to rest by clarifying on Facebook that she does not wish to return. Priyanka Jagga speaks to Salman Khan after her eviction. (COLORS) Priyanka posted on her Facebook page late Tuesday, “Friends I don’t want to go back to Big Boss 10..Support me. I love you all. Is kahani ka the End ho gaya hai..Kahani mai koi twist nai.. Enjoy jo karna hai karo yaaro.” Priyanka shared a good rapport with Swamiji on the show. Earlier, she also explained her stint inside the house: “Mai cricket nai khelrahi thi jo run banati..Kohli samajha tha kya mujhe..I m out .. Enjoy my eviction nd party do ek dusre ko . Nothing can break me down..Aur haan mere bacho aur pati ki tensiion na le toh aacha hai kyunki woh mere hai mere hi rahengey .. Koi unko mujhse alag nai kar sakta.. I m proud of them.. Hum char nai ek hai .. Award toh banta hai.” Priyanka had several fights with Bani, starting from day one. (COLORS) Though her stay inside the Bigg Boss house was short, it was certainly adventurous and eventful. Priyanka was the first one to disturb the peace of the house by picking fights with other inmates and criticising the food right on day one. She even found a ‘father-like’ figure in Om Swamiji. She did not miss a single opportunity to put the sevaks aka celebs in a tough spot. Her fights with TV actor Rohan Mehra or VJ Bani will definitely remain one of the lowest points of the season. Priyanka also had a few fights with Rohan Mehra. (COLORS) Bigg Boss 10: Who should be eliminated from the show?

The day does not begin on a happy note for the celebrities as the 'sevaks' do not follow their instructions and make breakfast according to their own wishes. Rohan Mehra questions Lokesh Kumari about not following orders to which Navin replies that he is the only person making breakfast and he won't be able to serve customised dishes. Rohan points out that the breakfast menu was discussed in advance and the Indiawale cannot back out at the last minute. When the other celebrities get to know about this, they decide to put the 'sevaks' in jail if they fail to obey their orders going forward.Bani-Nitibha sparSoon after, Bani and Nitibha have an argument after she refuses to make coffee for her. Bani tells Nitibha that she needs a cup of coffee before the task begins. Akansha butts in and tells Bani that the coffee will only be made once the Indiawale have their breakfast. When Bani continues to complain, Nitibha asks her to be a little patient. She later goes into the kitchen and criticises Bani’s behavior to her teammates.And it's back to the luxury laundry task...Later in the day, the second leg of the luxury budget task is announced where the both the teams have to wash, clean and iron the next batch of clothes. The team completing the consignment with the maximum amount of clothes will be declared the winner. Bigg Boss also asks quality inspectors Rohan and Nitibha to return the previous batch of clothes before they start washing the new ones. Akansha takes advantage of this opportunity and hides some of the clothes behind the pillar and underneath her boiler suit. As the clothes start coming in through the conveyor belt, the house turns into a battleground as both the teams try to secure the maximum amount of clothes. While doing the task, Swami Om accidentally drops a shirt which Bani picks up. Manu and Manveer notice this and then begin snatching it from her. Meanwhile, a scuffle with Manu leaves Rohan irritated. He complains about Manu to Bigg Boss. On the other hand, Manoj and Manu gang up on Rohan and call him names, resulting in a massive argument.Aggression takes over on the second day of the #BB10 Luxury Budget task!

He asks Mona why she didn't bring this up earlier, to which she says, she mentioned it to Karan and Bani, who ignored it. The misunderstanding then leads to an argument among the celebrities. Later in the day, Bigg Boss asks both the teams to get their final consignments checked from the respective quality inspectors and keep them ready for submission. Rohan delays his inspection process for the Indiawale and even rejects spotless clothes. Navin gets agitated over Rohan's behaviour and spills water on the celebrities’ final consignment. All hell breaks lose and the celebrities are furious with Navin for sabotaging their task.

The housemates wake up dancing to the tunes of the song Yaad Aa Raha Hain marking the dawn of a new day. They are surprised to find Jagga’s huge cutout placed in the garden area which further sparks several conversations. Indiawale end up breaking the primary rule of the Bigg Boss house by discussing nominations amongst each other. Bigg Boss is quick enough to point out their mistake and as a punishment, he makes Indiawale the new Sevaks while the celebrities are crowned as the Maliks of the house.Bigg Boss’s decision robs Indiawale of happiness as they take up the responsibilities of Sevaks and divide tasks amongst themselves. While they are seated in the dining area having lunch, Swamiji sits beside them and keeps barging in their conversations. While at first, they do not pay much attention to him, his continuous blabber irks Rahul and he asks him to leave. Swamiji finds celebrities’ behavior extremely rude and unrequired and he goes complaining about it to his team members. Soon after, another argument erupts between Manu and Lokesh after he asks her to make tea for him. Lokesh asks Akansha for help but it does not go down well with Manu. He tells Akansha that he specifically asked Lokesh to make tea for him and she should have told him upfront that she will not be able to do it rather than delegating it to someone else. In her defense, Lokesh says that she asked for Akansha’s help because she wanted to have a bath before she could take up any kitchen responsibility.While having a discussion with his fellow celebrity contestants, Karan expresses his concern over Monalisa and Manu’s growing closeness. He tells Monalisa that Manu is trying to get close to her while having a conversation and she needs to maintain a distance. Mona later confronts Manu and tells him what the celebrities feel about their friendship. Manu advises her to take decisions for hers own self and not to get manipulated by anyone.Later in the day, Bigg Boss announces nominations adding a new twist to it. In an open nomination, celebrities and Indiawale are required to nominate two members of the opposite team by smearing foam on their face. Also, they have to support their nomination with a suitable justification. Manveer Gujjar, Manu, Nitibha Kaul and Akansha Sharma are nominated from the Indiawale team. Rohan, Gaurav Chopra and Mona Lisa from the celebrity team also get nominated by the housemates. After the nominations, a fight breaks between Manveer and Swamiji where he blames him for not standing up for the team and as a result, strong members of their team are getting nominated. He also adds that Swamiji is acting double faced and also backstabbing his own team members. Later in the day, Swamiji once again becomes a topic of dispute after he has a heated argument with Navin on the dining table.With tempers soaring and competition getting tougher in the Bigg Boss house, will the celebrities be able to sustain their Malik status or will Indiawale snatch it away from them?

There is more to Priyanka Jagga than what meets the eyes. The former Bigg Boss contestant is like a secret chamber, whose every vault being unlocked, reveals something new about her. First, her shocking eviction justified why Bigg Boss 10 was not like any other season. Then her leaked picture outside the Bigg Boss set, hinting at her return in the house, left many wondering, followed by a lot of news about her personal life. Now a music video has surfaced featuring Priyanka in her glamorous avatar. WATCH: Bigg Boss 10, 28th October Review: Contestants Celebrate Diwali And Get Emotional The music number titled “Yaad” has been sung by Jyoti Singh. Its music has been composed by  DJ Sunny Singh and DJ Sulz, and has Priyanka playing a seductress. While the video has been posted on the internet only after her eviction, it definitely looks like it was shot much before Priyanka participated on the reality show. The makers of the music video are also trying to cash on the popularity of the 32-year-old. Check out the video here. Priyanka is a mysterious woman. Blame it on her chats with Bigg Boss host Salman Khan which left the audience intrigued about her real personality. Just days ago, her entertaining audition tape was doing the rounds.

It’s happening! Shah Rukh Khan and Alia Bhatt will promote Dear Zindagi on Bigg Boss 10. We wonder if Aamir Khan will make an appearance to promote Dangal, too! By Shweta Parande | Updated: November 7, 2016 8:40 PM IST Follow Email Comments DROP everything and listen to this piece of news! Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan is all set to make an appearance on Bigg Boss 10! Yes, the actor is back on Salman Khan‘s TV show! Remember last year on Bigg Boss 9 there was so much hype about the ‘Karan-Arjun’ of Bollywood coming together on the reality show, after they had patched up again and become the best of friends forever! The second patch-up of Shah Rukh Khan happened gradually, over multiple hugs at politician Baba Siddique’s Iftar parties at Eid over two years. And then, putting all negativity aside, Shah Rukh Khan was invited for the wedding of Salman Khan’s sister Arpita Khan to Ayush Sharma. Shah Rukh Khan did attend Arpita Khan’s wedding and blessed her. Such a sweet gesture! So then, after much speculation, Shah Rukh Khan visited the Bigg Boss 9 stage to promote his 2015 film Dilwale, a Rohit Shetty film in which he made a comeback with his favourite heroine Kajol after My Name is Khan. And now, the Bigg Boss 10 stage will again host Shah Rukh Khan, as he promotes his latest film, Dear Zindagi! Shah Rukh Khan and Alia Bhatt will appear on Bigg Boss 10, and we wonder what mischief Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan will be up to this time. On Bigg Boss 9, they brought the house down with their antics around their cult film Karan-Arjun where they ‘come back’ or are reincarnated to seek revenge and be with their mother (Rakhi). So, it’s happening! Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan on Bigg Boss 10 together, displaying their on-again friendship. Meanwhile, we wonder if the other Khan of the trio – Aamir Khan – will make an appearance on the Colors reality show! This is because Salman Khan and Aamir Khan now suddenly don’t see eye-to-eye thanks to their films based on the same subject of wrestling – Sultan and Dangal. While Sultan released earlier this year and was a super blockbuster, Dangal is up for a Christmas release on December 23. There are not only similarities between certain scenes of Sultan and Dangal but also an element of women’s empowerment. The difference is just that Yash Raj Films’ Sultan is fiction while Disney’s Dangal is purely a biopic on Mahavir Phogat. So, we wonder if Aamir Khan will promote Dangal on Bigg Boss 10! However, recently Salman Khan acknowledged that he had read the script of Dangal and that it was a better film than Sultan. Now, that’s generous of the Dabangg Khan, isn’t it? With the same generosity we hope he invites Aamir Khan onto Bigg Boss 10! For now, we are waiting for the Bigg Boss 10 episode featuring Shah Rukh Khan and Alia Bhatt to promote Dear Zindagi – we loved the ‘ruckus’ they created last night on Koffee with Karan 5! So, watch this space for Bigg Boss 10 starring Shah Rukh Khan, Alia Bhatt and Salman Khan!

SRK, who was pitted against Salman as an arch rival in the past, has now turned his BFF. And if the latest buzz is anything to go by, then the Badshah will make his presence felt on Sultan’s show Bigg Boss season 10. According to a report in India.com, Shah Rukh Khan may promote his film Dear Zindagi with Alia Bhatt on Salman’s show. Last year, Bollywood’s eternal Karan-Arjun jodi had set the small screen ablaze. Shah Rukh made his presence felt on the show to promote his film ‘Dilwale’. Both Salman and SRK displayed their camaraderie in the most hilarious way last year. And it would be interesting to see what the dashing duo have in store for their fans this time around. However, the makers of the show haven’t confirmed SRK’s appearance yet. Until then, keep asking, “mere Karan-Arjun kab aayenge?”!

Bigg Boss 10: Viewers react to rumours of Priyanka Jagga's return International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US Election World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Entertainment Bigg Boss Bigg Boss 10: Viewers react to rumours of Priyanka Jagga's return Priyanka Jagga was the first contestant to leave the Bigg Boss 10 house, followed by Akansha Sharma. Prarthna Sarkar November 6, 2016 17:03 IST Priyanka Jagga on Bigg Boss 10.Bigg Boss/ TwitterThe Bigg Boss house is a land of surprises, which are mostly unpleasant. Two weeks ago, a majority of viewers was rejoicing on social media over the eviction of Priyanka Jagga, but rumours of her reentering the show have interrupted the celebrations. If true, this development will surely change the dynamics within the house. Word has it she is being kept in a secret room and will be joined by Om Swami. During their stay in the room, the two will apparently have access to video footage that will help them keep an eye on fellow inmates. Why advertise with us?

Even though Jagga was, most of the times, loud and had a different approach to tackling fights, she was easily one of the strongest contenders for winning the show. Her eviction did leave her teammates in shock, but they moved on with time. In other news, in the weeks that Jagga has been eliminated, a lot has been written and said about her personal life. A certain Dj Gautam Arora, who claimed to be the contestant's ex-boyfriend, said that Jagga is a money-minded person who doesn't care much for people's emotions. He also said that she and her Canadian husband have been living separately for over three years now. Reacting to the claims, Jagga said that she is now determined to file a defamation suit against Arora. She urged people not to dig too deep into her personal life as she is capable of taking care of it.

Bigg Boss 10: Highlights from the weekend episodes | tv | Hindustan Times follow us: epaper india world cities opinion sports entertainment lifestyle tech photos videos more... black money crackdown us presidential election breathless in delhi ht long reads bigg boss 10 movie reviews ht paathshala Bigg Boss 10: Highlights from the weekend episodes Sweta Kaushal, Hindustan Times, New Delhi | Updated: Oct 24, 2016 13:33 IST With the contestants gearing up to survive the first eviction of the season, here’s a look at the highlights of Bigg Boss 10 through the weekend. (Colors) Just one week into the tenth season of Bigg Boss, and we already have an overdose of drama. The first weekend episodes of the reality show lived up to the frenzy the weekdays had built: From From Salman’s antics to his gyan for the contestants, the two episodes left fans asking for more. With the contestants gearing up to survive the first eviction of the season, here’s a look at the highlights of Bigg Boss 10 through the weekend. Read: Everything and anything about Bigg Boss Season 10 1. Priyanka’s eviction Priyanka Jagga’s ouster from the show shocked everyone. The 32-year-old mother didn’t know what hit her, and even the fans were left stunned. Conventional wisdom suggests that you survive on the show for longer if you create enough havoc inside the house. Priyanka, who not only picked up fights with celeb contestants at the smallest provocation but was more than ready to shed tears for anything and everything, stood out for her rude behaviour. She also came across as a “fake’ contestant. Since day one, she kept picking on the celebs and claimed to stand up for the rights of the common man. However, the incident where she cried and made a huge ruckus around the fact that the celebs thought her mom made beedis for a living, exposed her. 2. Lokesh floors Salman Lokesh Kumari Sharma is standing out in the crowd of contestants, and she has also managed to win for an unlikely fan: The show’s host, Salman Khan! Her Bigg Boss rap was a hit and Salman even asked her to perform the same for him. The Bollywood star also told Lokesh that she must continue behaving the way she is. 3. Salman appreciates Lopamudra It is not often that Salman appreciates women for taking a stand. When he did so and appreciated Lopa for standing up for herself, we were impressed. 4. Salman chides Swamiji Om Swamiji, who comes across as yet another fake contestant on the show in the garb of a common man, had to face Salman’s ire who told him to stop bothering the women in the house. These were the moments that caught our attention. What were the highlights for you?

The day started with the contestants waking up to the song ‘Saare Niyam Tod Do’ but are soon introduced to the new rule book that they have to follow for the entire week. According to the rule book, the celebrities asked to be sevaks to the commoners and oblige all their requests. Right from criticizing their culinary skills, to making them clean the swimming pool thrice a day, to not letting them take bath before they are done, the commoners ensure that the celebrities are treated in the most common way. Later in the evening, Bigg Boss introduces the most important process of the house- the first nominations of the season, where each commoner is asked to nominate 2 celebrities. The celebrities, on the other hand, are collectively asked to decide 2 names from the commoners that they would like to nominate.

The day starts with fight over tasteless food as Manoj questions the culinary skills of the celebrities. He comes whining to Karan and tells him that the food is ‘Vaahiyat’ and he would like to assist them in the kitchen going forward. Lopamudra jumps in the conversation and they soon have an argument. Priyanka Jagga, being at her cunning best, continues to reprimand the sevaks and forces them to follow her orders. Later in the day, Bigg Boss introduces the task ‘Raaz’ wherein the celebrities have to solve a riddle and find out that one big secret of the commoners. If they successfully decode all the secrets, they will become the maliks of the house while the Indiawale will become their sevaks. As soon as the task is introduced, fights and insecurities come to the fore while the gang of celebrities continue to strategize.

The Maliks seems to be going great in the game and giving sleepless nights to the Sevaks. In the wee hours of the night, the commoners do a secret meeting in the washroom area and decide to trouble the celebrities. After much planning and plotting, Priyanka instructs Swamiji to ring the ‘Hukm Ki Ghanti’ after the Sevaks are fast asleep and demand for food. Swamiji relents to Priyanks’s idea. Unwillingly, the Sevaks get up from their slumber and prepare food for Swamiji. The dining table heats up again as another massive argument breaks out between Om swami and Rahul Dev and Priyanka and Rohan. Priyanka even punishes Rohan thereafter and asks him to wash her clothes in the middle of the night. In the midst of all this, Bigg Boss introduces two more riddles and asks the celebrities to decode the secret. Adding some more twist to the game, Bigg Boss introduces Appy Fizz bubble task where the Maliks now have the liberty to tie down the Sevaks by locking their ankles to a chain and keep them from discussing the riddles with each other.

It has exposed the real self of many contestants inside the house, one of them being Priyanka Jagga. Fights and disputes have become her sole weapon to stay strong in the game. As Bigg Boss introduces the next riddle for the Sevak’s stating that the mother of one of the commoners works at a beedi factory for her living, Sevaks make few wrong guesses and attribute the secret to Priyanka Jagga. Taking offense to this, Priyanka loses her temper and firmly replies that her mother is a lawyer and does not work at a beedi factory. Her devious avatar comes into the picture and knowingly or unknowingly she ends up hurting many people around. Bigg Boss calls Karan and Priyanka in the confession room and hands over an envelope with their family pictures and a box of sweets to break their Karwachauth fast. After seeing the pictures, Priyanka and Karan get emotional and thank Bigg Boss for the kind gesture.

Part of the Indiawale camp, Canada based Priyanka Jagga was the first contestant to get eliminated in Bigg Boss 10. Priyanka's name was announced by the host, Salman Khan in Sunday's episode. Although, the show began just a week back, but Priyanka managed to grab headlines for her constant arguments with the celebrity camp especially MTV VJ Bani. Mother of two, Priyanka shocked many when she urinated in her pants while performing a task inside the Bigg Boss house. She had later asked Bani to wash the pants for her. During her stay inside the Bigg Boss house, Priyanka did not share a pleasant relationship with her celebrity counterparts and was often seen having a war of words with them. Be it her spat with Bani over her age or etiquettes or with Rohan for spilling water on her, Priyanka did not spare a single person who tried to mess with her. As a self-proclaimed daughter of Swamiji and a confidant of Manoj and Manveer, Priyanka picked many fights for her fellow Indiawale team members. Her squabble with Monalisa over the Karwachauth puja certainly made her the villain of the house but during the rocking horse task, Priyanka proved that there is so much more to her than just being a motor mouth. With her endurance and determination, she saved the Indiawale contestants from losing the Maliks tag and gave Gaurav Chopraa a strong competition. The Sunday's episode saw former Bigg Boss contestant, Kamya Punjabi joining Salman Khan as a Bigg Boss analyst and sharing few words of wisdom. Salman gave a sneak peek of the ranking task to Kamya and asked her opinion on how the contestants are conducting themselves inside the house. Kamya mentioned that while Indiawale are playing the game cautiously and smartly, celebrities are dawdling and not showing efforts in performing the tasks. Priyanka's elimination came as a surprise to most people as she was seen as a strong contender.

She's a Delhi-based mother-of-two, and a model.Image courtesy: TwitterJagga had caused quite some consternation among the housemates with what was perceived as her high-handed behaviour. With the celebrity contestants being asked to serve the non-celebrity contenders, Jagga was among those who made life difficult for the other team with her demands.Perhaps unsurprisingly, she was among those chosen for elimination in the first 'Weekend Ka Vaar' episode. Actors Gaurav Chopra and Monalisa were the other contestants who were also nominated for elimination. They have made it through to the next week.For Jagga, however, this is the end of the road on Bigg Boss 10 — unless she comes back later as a 'wild card entrant', a trick the show has pulled in previous seasons as well.Related NewsBigg Boss 10 Episode 23, 8 November 2016: No more malik, sevaks; all contestants mergeBigg Boss 10 Episode 21, 7th November 2016 written episode: Nominations become a game of sacrifice Comment using DisqusPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Show Comments LIVE Zimbabwe Vs Sri Lanka Live Score ZIM vs SL | Nov 6th, 2016Live Coverage SL 102 4 40.0RUNSWKTSOVERSCricket ScoresCurrent & RecentUpcomingPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 7 wickets (D/L method) Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Live Now Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Papua New Guinea beat Hong Kong by 14 runs Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 106 runs South Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS Vs SA South Africa beat Australia by 177 runs Pakistan and West Indies in UAE, 3 Test Series, 2016 PAK Vs WI West Indies beat Pakistan by 5 wickets New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ India beat New Zealand by 190 runs Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Sri Lanka beat Zimbabwe by 225 runs England in Bangladesh, 2 Test Series, 2016 BAN Vs ENG Bangladesh beat England by 108 runs New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ New Zealand beat India by 19 runs England in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 9th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 12th, 2016, 05:00 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 14th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 16th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTPakistan in New Zealand, 2 Test Series, 2016 NZ vs PAK - Nov 17th, 2016, 03:00 AM ISTEngland in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 17th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs WI - Nov 19th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 21st, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 23rd, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 24th, 2016, 09:00 AM ISTMORE STORIES FROMFP Staff Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes scrapped: Govt releases FAQ to help you make sense of it all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banned: New Rs 2,000 currency note to feature Mangalyaan, raised bleed lines Rs 500, Rs 1,000 note ban: Industry terms it 'watershed' moment in fight against black money Rs 500, Rs 1,000 notes banned, new Rs 2,000 note: Twitterati expect major real estate crash New Rs 2,000 note, Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banned, withdrawal limit set: Key points from PM Modi's addressView more site indexAbout FirstpostNewsletterRSSTwitterFacebookVerticalsFront PageIndiaPoliticsWorldBusinessLifeBollywoodSportsTechPlusNew DelhiMumbaiPhotosFP ExclusivesCartoonsVideo RoomeBooksBudget 2014WeatherOthersSample Papers OnlineBusiness Technology NewsMTV IndiaOnline Shopping in IndiaThink IndiaISL 2016Worksheet for KidsUS Election 2016ToolsRSS FeedsAppsiOSAndroidWindows Copyright © 2016 Firstpost - All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy

Whoever said that the latest season of Bigg Boss would be just like any other previous ones, well the show is already proving them wrong. Bigg Boss 10, which is being hosted by actor Salman Khan, kicked off on a fabulous note and has already seen the sparks of major clashes in its day 1 episode. We saw how Bani and Priyanka had a tiff over some misunderstood question about age, the way Swami’s over-assertive arguments aren’t going down too well with the housemates and how Manoj Punjabi is trying his best to keep an upper hand among the commoners. This and a lot more is in store this entire week. But one thing that is set to turn rather exciting is the show’s first luxury budget task. After all, it will reveal some deep dark secrets of the common contestants. Watch Bigg Boss 10 Day 1: First Nominations & Review In a preview clip of day 2, we see that the common people were asked to write down their hidden secrets on a piece of paper and lock them in a bottle before they entered the house. Now, Bigg Boss will throw a challenge to the celebrity contestants to guess the unknown side of the commoners, if they want to earn the luxury points for their budget. The entire group of eight common people who entered the house have so far come across as aam-aadmi, but it won’t be wrong to say that each one of them might have some secrets which can change the flow of the entire show. Check out the preview clip of Bigg Boss 10’s first luxury task. Raaz, the first luxury budget task for the season! Will the celebrities be able to complete it successfully? #BB10 http://t.co/4RHXhq7tp2 — Bigg Boss (@BiggBoss) October 18, 2016 We tried to dig into the past of these common contestants and found out that Manoj Punjabi is not really a commoner. He has had his brush with stardom in 2013 when he participated in The Bachelorette India: Mere Khayalon Ki Mallika, a reality show in which actor Mallika Sherawat was supposed to find ‘the perfect bachelor’ for herself. In #BiggBoss10, who should be evicted in Week 1? — IE entertainment (@ieEntertainment) October 18, 2016 Also read | Bigg Boss 10 contestant Manoj Punjabi, who claims to be a commoner is actually a celebrity, see pics Swami Om, who claims to be a tantrik, also has a past which he might not want the housemates to know. Well, he had once slapped and abused a woman on national television during a debate and the old video left us shocked when we got hold of it. Each commener participating in Bigg Boss 10 has some secret which they have kept under wraps until now.

He is controversial godman Swami Omji Maharaj who is a contestant in the reality show Bigg Boss 10. But away from his spiritual avatar, this baba is also allegedly an arms hoarder who has been slapped with cases under the Arms Act, TADA and other laws.While he is doing his bit to create an impression at the reality show, Maharaj is now facing non-bailable warrants as he did not appear before a Delhi court in a theft case.The warrants were issued two days before the premiere of Bigg Boss 10 where commoners and celebrities are contesting. Maharaj has stepped into the house as a commoner.THEFT CASE Maharaj was issued the fourth bailable warrant in the theft case. The court had fixed October 14 for hearing the arguments on the charge.

The countdown has begun. The clock is ticking as the passing minutes mark the advent of Indian television’s most awaited reality show, Bigg Boss. This weekend, the common man will embark on a journey-of-a-lifetime to stand as equals against celebrity contestants. And, this epic battle has the perfect setting! The Bigg Boss house, this year, is themed to appear as a modern Indian palace with elements of mystique that invoke sentiments like vigour and positivity. Making the stay an intriguing roller coaster ride for these contestants for the next 100+ days, the Bigg Boss 10 house has been designed by Omung Kumar along with his wife Vanita.Commenting on the house, co-designer Omung Kumar said, “The Bigg Boss house, this year, has an ethereal look. The design of the Bigg Boss house has been themed around a modern Indian palace. There is an element of Indian mystique to the décor with a lot of lanterns and earthy tones to bring a homely appeal to the set. And, the house is more colourful and vibrant this time with lots of paintings. There are many conspicuous changes in the Bigg Boss house. The orientation of the living room and the bedroom have been interchanged, with a special seven-sleeper bed space being created for select contestants. We’re also adding a touch of luxury to the Bigg Boss house with the introduction of a Jacuzzi corner in the bathroom. The design elements have been incorporated to create a balanced experience for both celebrity and common man contestants.”Adding further, he said, “The most prominent addition to the Bigg Boss house, however, is the jail. Painted to depict a filthy appearance, the jail will be a dungeon of sorts for contestants who break the rules. There is a special Indian-style bathroom installed for the qaidis, and an earthen pot along with aluminium plates and mugs to make the entire experience more real.”Here’s a quick look at the grandiose and unique elements doused in majestic beauty and aura, that promise to make the Bigg Boss house a true visual treat.A royal paletteA vibrant environment is all that one needs to inculcate feelings of positivity and comfort. This year, the Bigg Boss house is filled with bright and lively hues of pink, purple, gold and royal blue with some intricate and trendy designs that will leave you mesmerised.The chamber of ‘bedroom’ secretsThis year, the contestants’ mornings will be filled with bright sunlight as the altered positions of the living room and bedroom brings in some warm rays. The bedroom area features not only seven single beds but also one big googly for the unsuspecting contestants. While 7 contestants will take the single beds, the remaining will have to share a massive bed which has been placed against a wall. A first-time addition is a walk-in closet adorned with full-length mirrors to ensure that the contestants look their absolute best at all times.Kingly confessionsThe confession room is one place where the contestants can shed all their inhibitions and share their deepest secrets and desires with Bigg Boss. And this year, this room promises to make the contestants feel like royalty. The seat will be a classic emulation of a King’s throne covered in deep and glittery gold. With the walls covered in deep red and rustic lamps suspended from the ceiling, the confession room promises to be a sight for sore eyes.Dungeon of errorsContestants have always been prone to making errors and breaking the rules of the Bigg Boss house. This year, the house brings back one of its darkest elements, the jail. Painted to appear filthy to its inmates, the jail is splattered with the gruesome material; this dungeon promises to be as good as hell. Located in a corner in the garden area, the jail has two iron khatiyas with dusty bedding. Aluminium utensils, an earthen water pot and an Indian-style washroom, the Bigg Boss jail will give suitable punishment to those who err.Modern royal bathThe newest addition to the bathroom area, this season, is a luxurious Jacuzzi placed in a corner which allows every relaxing contestant a full view of the entire room. A pristine white Jacuzzi in a royal purple washroom adorned with peacock graphics, the bathroom promises to create a rejuvenating, revitalising and relaxing environment allowing the contestants to unwind.Feisty feastsContinuing with this royal backdrop is the Bigg Boss house’s most-loved space – the kitchen. Be it tiffs on daily responsibilities, gossip sessions or more, the kitchen has always found itself in the midst of its all. This year, the kitchen is the ultimate epitome of class and style. Its earthy tones and country design will bring a touch of home to this otherwise royal home. And this is extended to the dining table where a large curved table will form the basis for many conversations and food-related quarrels. All these elements are supported by the garden area which features a swimming pool, gym area and a specially-created Appy Fizz zone for the contestants to take a break from the daily tasks, making their Bigg Boss journey more enjoyable.(All Image courtesy: Colors) bb10Bigg Boss 10Bigg Boss 10 houseSalman Khan Trending Articles President Pranab Mukherjee Calls for Closer India, UK Ties Against TerrorBigg Boss 10: Nitibha Wins Immunity, Nominations Test RelationsIndia vs England: May the Best Team Win, Says PM Narendra ModiFire Breaks Out in Sadar Bazar Slum, 30 Fire Tenders on Spot Trending Articles President Pranab Mukherjee Calls for Closer India, UK Ties Against TerrorBigg Boss 10: Nitibha Wins Immunity, Nominations Test RelationsIndia vs England: May the Best Team Win, Says PM Narendra ModiFire Breaks Out in Sadar Bazar Slum, 30 Fire Tenders on SpotDangerous to Drink Coffee With Karan Johar: Twinkle KhannaKoffee With Karan: Will Akshay,Twinkle's Episode Be the Most Outrageous One?Will Rahul Gandhi Be Able To Revive The Grand Old Party?News360: Change Of Guard To Change Congress Fortune?

To the seven celebrity contestants in the mix in Bigg Boss 2016 — Karan Mehra, Rohan Mehra, Lopamudra Raut, Gaurav Chopra, Monalisa, Rahul Dev and Bani J — have been added eight 'common' folks.Here's the thing, however, at least three of those 'common folk' aren't exactly that.One — the self-styled godman Swami Om (who has quickly earned the tag of Bigg Boss' 'creepiest contestant ever') — was on at least one TV panel. Yes, the one where he spoke in praise of colleague Radhe Maa and slapped fellow panelist, astrologer Deepa Sharma, when their argument escalated. By his own boast, he's also 'cured Elizabeth Hurley of backache'. Infamy may not be the same as celebrity, but that certainly doesn't make Om Swami like the rest of us regular people.Then there's Akanksha Sharma. Her backstory has already got the young contestant plenty of attention — she's cricketer Yuvraj Singh's former sister-in-law. Apparently, her parting from husband Zoravar Singh (Yuvraj's younger brother) was quite acrimonious and she has accused her mother-in-law for their marital problems. Shabnam Singh addressed these allegations by Akanksha in an interview with Hindustan Times.And a report by The Indian Express points out that Manoj Punjabi (who goes by "Manu") was among the contestants on The Bachelorette India: Mere Khayalon Ki Mallika in 2013, vying for actress Mallika Sherawat's "hand".Priyanka Jagga seems to have modelled sporadically, while Navin Prakash has appeared on at least one Newshour debate, where he's shown that he has the wonderful ability to shout others down, a trait that should help him in the Bigg Boss house.At present, Nitibha Kaul, Manveer Gujjar and Lokesh Kumari Sharma seem to be the only contestants who can actually claim to be regular people with no connection to the glamour/television/reality show industry.How long that state of affairs will last, is anyone's guess.Related NewsBigg Boss 10 Episode 23, 8 November 2016: No more malik, sevaks; all contestants mergeBigg Boss 10 Episode 21, 7th November 2016 written episode: Nominations become a game of sacrifice Comment using DisqusPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.Show Comments LIVE Zimbabwe Vs Sri Lanka Live Score ZIM vs SL | Nov 6th, 2016Live Coverage SL 102 4 40.0RUNSWKTSOVERSCricket ScoresCurrent & RecentUpcomingPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 7 wickets (D/L method) Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Live Now Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Papua New Guinea beat Hong Kong by 14 runs Papua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK Vs PNG Hong Kong beat Papua New Guinea by 106 runs South Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS Vs SA South Africa beat Australia by 177 runs Pakistan and West Indies in UAE, 3 Test Series, 2016 PAK Vs WI West Indies beat Pakistan by 5 wickets New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ India beat New Zealand by 190 runs Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM Vs SL Sri Lanka beat Zimbabwe by 225 runs England in Bangladesh, 2 Test Series, 2016 BAN Vs ENG Bangladesh beat England by 108 runs New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016 IND Vs NZ New Zealand beat India by 19 runs England in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 9th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 12th, 2016, 05:00 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 14th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 16th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTPakistan in New Zealand, 2 Test Series, 2016 NZ vs PAK - Nov 17th, 2016, 03:00 AM ISTEngland in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 17th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs WI - Nov 19th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 21st, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 23rd, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 24th, 2016, 09:00 AM ISTMORE STORIES FROMFP Staff Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes scrapped: Govt releases FAQ to help you make sense of it all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banned: New Rs 2,000 currency note to feature Mangalyaan, raised bleed lines Rs 500, Rs 1,000 note ban: Industry terms it 'watershed' moment in fight against black money Rs 500, Rs 1,000 notes banned, new Rs 2,000 note: Twitterati expect major real estate crash New Rs 2,000 note, Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banned, withdrawal limit set: Key points from PM Modi's addressView more site indexAbout FirstpostNewsletterRSSTwitterFacebookVerticalsFront PageIndiaPoliticsWorldBusinessLifeBollywoodSportsTechPlusNew DelhiMumbaiPhotosFP ExclusivesCartoonsVideo RoomeBooksBudget 2014WeatherOthersSample Papers OnlineBusiness Technology NewsMTV IndiaOnline Shopping in IndiaThink IndiaISL 2016Worksheet for KidsUS Election 2016ToolsRSS FeedsAppsiOSAndroidWindows Copyright © 2016 Firstpost - All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy

Kameshwari | New Delhi | Updated: October 26, 2016 12:45 pm Bigg Boss 10 October 25: Housemates compete in a task for luxury budget, which involves washing and ironing clothes. The second week of Bigg Boss 10 has started on a high energy note, keeping us on the edge of our seats with excitement and nervousness. The tables have turned and celebs are now the Maliks and Indiawale are not enjoying being their Sevaks. And in the middle of this lands the second week’s luxury task. Bigg Boss has asked contestants to wash clothes and the one who can manage the maximum number will be the winner. The new task, called BB laundry, is an arduous task involving washing, cleaning and ironing clothes. A conveyor belt is placed in the garden area through which different types of clothes are sent in. The housemates are divided into two teams – celebrities are team blue while Indiawale are team orange. WATCH VIDEO: Bigg Boss 10: Review Of October 25 Episode Also read | Suyyash Rai, Kishwer Merchant begin preparations for their December wedding, see pic Once the conveyor belt starts moving, members of both the teams have to pick their set of clothes by standing behind the barricade and wash, clean and iron them. They have to present the clean clothes to an inspector from the opposition team. The inspector is given the power to accept only those clothes which are well laundered and ironed. While Rohan has been elected as the inspector for Team Orange, Nitibha is the inspector for Team Blue. The winner of the task will not only have the opportunity to decide the luxury budget but it will also have implications on ‘satta parivartan’ and nominations.

We would see, for the first time, Rahul Dev being all aggressive and getting into a verbal spat with Indiawale. Seems like Kamya Punjabi’s advice to the actor has made him realise that this show is not about being good but being good in the eyes of the audience. Watch Bigg Boss 10 October 24 episode review here: Mona Lisa, who was warned in the October 24 episode about Manoj Punjabi’s intention towards her, has confronted Manoj about what the celebs have to say about him. While Mona gets all emotional while talking to him, Manoj makes her understand that people will talk but she should be the one to judge what is right or wrong between them. ‘Aap vishwas aur samman, dono ke layak nahi,’ – #NavinPrakash to #OmSwami! #BB10 #SneakPeek #ManuPunjabi http://t.co/9Xf6BYdef6 — COLORS (@ColorsTV) October 24, 2016 If it is an episode of fights and arguments, how can Swami Om stay away?

While a majority of contestants took up the show for Salman Khan and fame, a few took up the show purely for money. One such contestant is Rahul Dev. The actor openly admitted having taken up the show for money. He said to a media agency, "I am doing 'Bigg Boss' due to financial reasons. I did the show for my son Siddharth who is studying abroad. I need the money to support his education. This time I was offered a good deal so I agreed to do the show." He further elaborated, "I was invited for the previous seasons of 'Bigg Boss' as well but earlier I was not keen on doing it. This time when they approached me it was a spontaneous decision. I just came on board two days before it went on air." While in the Saturday aka Waar episode, Rahul confessed on National Television that he was already feeling exhausted in just one week and that BB house has definitely changed him for the better.

Here’s why With Bigg Boss host Salman Khan surrounded by enough controversies, the actor has more reasons to be inside the house as a contestant. But that's not all.

Salman Khan is both entertaining and engaging. He is entertaining on screen and engaging off screen. His on-screen acts entertain and his off-screen one-liners engage one when he is not entertaining. Either way, he manages to hold one’s attention – a rare achievement when a viewer’s attention is shorter than ever before. WATCH VIDEO: Bigg Boss 10 Premiere Review He has this rare ability to be hugely controversial and popularly unpopular — now aren’t both the prerequisites of being a Bigg Boss contestant? In fact, we think Salman Khan should relinquish the seat of the host and celebrate Bigg Boss’ tenth anniversary by going inside the house as a celebrity contestant. His USP? His ability to shock, of course. Salman made a slew of statements that sparked a series of discussions this year, giving tough competition to the likes of KRK. In July, Salman’s comment on rape –“when I used to walk out of the ring, after the shoot, I used to feel like a raped woman”- made headlines. Even as his rape comment controversy was ready to die down, Salman made yet another statement. Apparently, Salman frankly put forth his views on the ban on Pakistani actors saying – “They are artistes, not terrorists. It’s the government who gives those permits and visas.” The actor was also acquitted by the Rajasthan High Court in two poaching cases earlier this year. Cue: More Twitter memes than you could keep a track of. Big Boss has always welcomed the controversial figures including Rakhi Sawant, Kamal R Khan and Ajaz Khan. Salman is way ahead of all these celebrities in that department. But that’s not all. Consider this: What makes one qualify to enter Bigg Boss house? One can only guess. However, the least a contestant is expected to do is to engage people. Now, there is a very thin line between entertaining and engaging. Not all entertainers can be engaging. Otherwise, all top TV actors would have been chosen as final contestants. Bigg Boss makers want people who can involve the audience with their personality, mood swings, link-ups, quirkiness, anger and the list goes on. Those who can arrest the short span of viewers’ attention and stretch it for a couple of months. Salman Khan can surely engage people by skills other than that of making a statement. The actor is believed to be a good painter. However, no one has seen him painting live. As many contestants flaunt their creativity (as there is nothing to do much with zero interaction with outside world), Salman can win some hearts and extend his stay in the house. Salman made a slew of statements that sparked a series of discussions this year, giving tough competition to the likes of KRK. But how long one can paint? That won’t be a much problem either. We all know that Salman Khan is single. There are all possibilities that he can get romantically involved with some other ‘lovely’ contestant. Even as a host, Salman was generous in heaping praise on some of the past contestants. Remember Salman getting flirty with Elli Avram and Mandana Karimi. If all this doesn’t seem good enough to make Salman eligible for Bigg Boss, how about his ‘angry’ mood swings. Salman might be the ‘Bhai’ of Bollywood but making him angry is like stirring up a hornet’s nest. Vivek Oberoi and Arijit Singh should know. People would love to watch someone so dominating. And there are moments inside the house when members open up and talk about their personal experiences. Salman can share some of his own experiences and tales. And you can bank on the whole of India tuning in to listen. Seeing Salman Khan inside the house can be one joyride full of twists and turns for his fans and critics alike. Moreover, Salman can very well escape the house with impunity, unlike real life. It doesn’t matter if wins or loses at the end. And this time Daddy dear Salim Khan will not have to write an apology letter also. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & InstagramOpinionAre banks equipped to replace 2,300 crore pieces of Rs 500, Rs 1,000 notes?WorldUS presidential elections 2016 LIVE: Clinton has 70 per cent chance of winning, says top pollsterBusinessDemonetising Rs 500, 1000 notes a very bold step to fight black money: RBIBusinessRs 500 and 1000 currency demonitised: PM ModiIndiaJ&K: Jawan killed as Pak troops violate ceasefire in Naushera, firing continuesEntertainmentWe are not good swimmers: Kannada actors said minutes before they drowned, watch videoEntertainmentShivaay box office: Ajay Devgn film bests Ae Dil Hai Mushkil in second weekEntertainmentMastigudi makers booked for culpable homicide, Kannada actors' bodies yet to be foundEntertainmentAishwarya's new photoshoot has made us forget ADHM Must ReadSportsIndia vs England, 2016: Ready to hum immigrant songSportsCook back where he beganSportsEngland’s lesser-known fan army-Addis lands in RajkotTechnologyLenovo Phab 2 Plus first look: Dual camera and AR are the highlightsTechnologySony Xperia XZ review: A great flagship device, but competition is toughTechnologyMotorola Moto M goes official: Specifications, price and featuresLifestyleScientists say this song is the most relaxing song in the world Nov 08: Latest News Amit Shah invokes triple talaq to strike at ‘three parties’: Are you with or against it?01:52 am, Nov 09, 2016Simultaneous Lok Sabha, Assembly polls: Delhi HC junks plea but calls it ‘good idea’01:40 am, Nov 09, 2016US Presidential elections 2016: Wall Street climbs as investors bet on Hillary Clinton victory01:44 am, Nov 09, 2016Rs 500, Rs 1000 notes declared illegal: RBI issues 25-point FAQ explaining move01:38 am, Nov 09, 2016Rishabh Pant: Season’s smash hit breaks another record01:38 am, Nov 09, 2016 DIPTI SHARMATwitter<a href="https://twitter.com/diptisharma10"> @diptisharma10</a>... read more Priyanka Chopra: Why it’s important to celebrate her achievementsWill Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil live up to the idea of romance?Ashwini Ekbote was so involved with her work, we had to calm her down: Co-star Bhagyesh Desai DIPTI SHARMATwitter<a href="https://twitter.com/diptisharma10"> @diptisharma10</a>... read more Priyanka Chopra: Why it’s important to celebrate her achievementsWill Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil live up to the idea of romance?Ashwini Ekbote was so involved with her work, we had to calm her down: Co-star Bhagyesh Desai The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Building the ever growing buzz around reality show Bigg Boss, the show makers have shared new promo videos on Sunday. The tenth season of the controversial reality show is set to premiere Sunday night with Bollywood star Salman Khan as the host. read more In defence of Bigg Boss Salman Khan is back with Bigg Boss 10 promo Did Salman opt for a pay cut in Bigg Boss 10? Bigg Boss 10: No celebs The promos give us a sneak peek inside the Bigg Boss house that has been designed by director Oomung Kumar and his wife Vanita. Commenting on the house, co-designer Omung Kumar said, “The Bigg Boss house, this year, has an ethereal look. The design of the Bigg Boss house, has been themed around a modern Indian palace. There is an element of Indian mystique to the décor with a lot of lanterns and earthy tones to bring a homely appeal to the set. And, the house is more colorful and vibrant this time with lots of paintings. There are many conspicuous changes in the Bigg Boss house. The orientation of the living room and the bedroom have been interchanged, with a special seven-sleeper bed space being created for select contestants. We’re also adding a touch of luxury to the Bigg Boss house with the introduction of a jacuzzi corner in the bathroom. The design elements have been incorporated to create a balanced experience for both celebrity and common man contestants.” He went on to add, “The most prominent addition to the Bigg Boss house, however, is the jail. Painted to depict a filthy appearance, the jail will be a dungeon of sorts for contestants who break the rules. There is a special Indian-style bathroom installed for the qaidis, and an earthen pot along with aluminium plates and mugs to make the entire experience more real.” In a shift from it popular format, the show will focus on the common man this year, allowing non-celebrities to contest the show along with known faces. Bigg Boss is on the lines of the British television show Big Brother. The show’s format keeps participants locked inside a house for three months with no access to the outside world. Salman returns as the host for the seventh season in a row with Bigg Boss 10. “This is my seventh season as host of Bigg Boss. Each season is exceptional in its own way. But with known faces, you know or at least think you know what to expect. Each time the show has surprises galore. But this time, there is a kahani mein twist. The presence of the common man promises a most uncommon season. So expect the unexpected,” Salman said in a statement.
